As a rule of thumb, if the vocabulary size is much larger than perplexity, then the model is performing well.  \n",
    "There is a big caveat regarding perplexity and how the n-gram model was set up. If a given m-gram (where m=n-1) is not contained within the corpus, then the model will generate the next token piking the last token of any n-gram in the corpus, based on its total number of counts (i.e. the higher the count the most probable the last token of a particular n-gram will be picked as the next token to be generated). This is a palliative mechanism to avoid the model halting. If this happen and the ground truth label is not present in the corpus, with regards to perplexity these are deemed as \"invalid tests\". On the other hand, if the label is contained within a corpus these will be regarded as \"valid tests\". The perplexity is only calculated for valid tests, as the model would be \"infinitely perplex\" by tokens not present in the vocabulary.  "

    "## Conclusions \n",
    "\n",
    "Although of course the quality of the n-gram and LSTM-based toy models in not comparable to a state the art large language model trained on a huge corpus, and using supervised and reinforcement learning like chatGPT, they at least do quite a good job at capturing the writing style of the set they where trained on.  \n",
    "They also managed to produce some fully coherent (albeit short) phrases like `the english lady waited in the window .` (James Joyce 6-size window LSTM model, with 50 words considered).  \n",
    "A few longer phrases are also relatively coherent, for example: `a gin for me to see so many cadets from the commonwealth and to all those who lost their lives , and the commonwealth and around the world , australians are`, taken from the queen of England 4-gram model, and considering all words.  \n",
    "The models also managed to capture or learn (in the case of LSTM models) things like digits generally appearing one after another (as in `i love the commonwealth - canada , 1 1 march 2 0 0 2 2 is not a year of the diversity that has necessarily kept people apart has , quite simply`, for the queen of England 3-gram model considering all words in the vocabulary), or to add question marks when prompted with a context structured like a question; for example, when prompted with `where are you father flynn` the James Joyce 6-size window LSTM model with all word considered, produced: `where are you father flynn ?” said mr o ’ connor .`   \n",
    "All models produced poor results very lacking in creativity when the taking only the most probable token for generation. Results got much better when picking among the 50 most probable, or from all tokens within the vocabulary.  \n",
    "All in all the models produced some interesting phrases like `ireland is german .`, `the scottich pleased , the queen ' s bombings in london from persecution .` or `they walked along nassau street and walked up to dublin and holland ; and , carrying them to the man ’ s , and thanks ever so much the better for`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the differences between the n-gram and LSTM models, the n-gram models are very quick to create as, unlike LSTMs, they do not require training. On the other hand, neural network-based models have the potential to capture much more sophisticated language patterns.   \n",
    "Perplexity-wise, when this metric could actually be computed, n-gram models scored significantly better than LSTMs ones. As mentioned before however, the n-gram models are completely perplexed a good amount of the times. The first n-gram model constructed in the notebook, for example, got a perplexity of around 8 for 25% of the tests, while being utterly perplexed for around 75% of the tests. In contrast, the LSTM model scored an average perplexity of around 350 across the board; significantly higher, but more consistent.  \n",
    "The James Joyce 6-size window LSTM model scored by far the highest perplexity of close to 43,500. This could be explained by its significantly bigger vocabulary size when compared to that of the queen's models. Despite this, the model managed to create results of comparable quality to other models, highlighting the importance of not taking perplexity as the sole metric for judging the performance of a language model. It should be regarded contextually, taking into account the inherit complexity of the corpus and model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitatively, all models produced results of similar caliber, and it would be hard to tell with which model trained on the same corpus a particular sentence was created. "
