Opening ceremony, eighth General Synod of the Church of England, 15 Nov 2005
When limitless amounts of information, much of it ephemeral, are instantly accessible on demand, there is a renewed hunger for that which endures and gives meaning.
Your Graces, the Convocations of Canterbury and York, duly called together in obedience to Our Royal Writs, are on this day joined together in accordance with the Synodical Government Measure 1969 and the House of Laity is added to them in accordance with the Measure, so as to constitute the Eighth General Synod of the Church of England.
Thank you for your welcome.
Prince Philip and I are delighted to be with you today and I am very pleased to inaugurate the General Synod once again.
The thirty-five years since the introduction of synodical government are but a brief span in Church history, yet they have witnessed changes in our world more rapid and far reaching perhaps than in any previous generation.
For Christians, this pace of change represents an opportunity.
When so much is in flux, when limitless amounts of information, much of it ephemeral, are instantly accessible on demand, there is a renewed hunger for that which endures and gives meaning.
The Christian church can speak uniquely to that need, for at the heart of our faith stands the conviction that all people, irrespective of race, background or circumstances, can find lasting significance and purpose in the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
At the same time, the nature and speed of change pose many challenges and dilemmas.
Arrangements and legislation conceived in earlier days may no longer be exactly what the Church now requires.
Yet the processes for securing change can themselves be time consuming and require much perseverance.
Similarly, in its engagement with the changing community it seeks to serve, the Church has to find a way of being contemporary and adaptable while still remaining true to those convictions which are of lasting value.
Like each new Synod you will be faced with legislation to consider, reports to debate, budgets to scrutinise.
The completion in July of a long programme of major liturgical revision has relieved your agenda of one set of pressures.
You have, however, inherited from the last Synod a substantial series of proposed reforms which can only be achieved by means of fresh legislation.
I know that you will also want to ensure that this necessary scrutiny leaves time for addressing many of the wider social, economic and ethical questions facing communities both in this country and further afield.
One priority for the coming period will undoubtedly be the further deepening of relations between all the Christian churches in this land.
It was with great pleasure that I witnessed, two years ago, the signing of the Covenant between the Methodist Church and the Church of England, a new relationship symbolised by the choice of a distinguished Methodist theologian as the preacher at this morning's service.
At a time when the Christian family is rightly increasing its efforts to promote greater dialogue and understanding with those of other faiths, it remains important that the goal of full visible unity among the Churches should continue to be at the heart of the Synod's concerns.
Times of change place particular demands on those called to positions of leadership.
When Synod was opened five years ago neither Archbishop was in his present office - indeed, unusually, neither was a member of the General Synod.
The beginning of the Archbishop of York's new ministry at the end of this month marks an important new chapter in the life of the Church and of the Anglican Communion.
He and the Archbishop of Canterbury will be carrying a heavy burden of responsibility over the next few years, not least in preparing for the next Lambeth Conference of 2008.
They will each need and will, I know, receive the full support of this Synod.
In these days of change and opportunity, it will be well to call to mind the words of the hymn that warns against expecting a life which is for ever in green pastures or by still waters.
Opening of the exhibition 'Women and War', Imperial War Museum, 14 October 2003
Over the two World Wars and in the many conflicts since then, women in Britain and throughout the Commonwealth have faced and overcome all manner of challenges.
Mr.
Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,I am delighted to launch the 'Women and War' Exhibition which shows how important the role of women has been in time of war.
Over the two World Wars and in the many conflicts since then, women in Britain and throughout the Commonwealth have faced and overcome all manner of challenges.
From my experience as a 2nd Subaltern in the ATS I began to understand the esprit de corps that flourishes in the face of adversity and forges friendships which last a lifetime.
Throughout my reign I have watched with admiration how women in the three Services and many related organisations have taken on wider responsibilities and ever more demanding roles on land, on sea and in the air.
This exhibition is a tribute to their spirit and to that vital contribution made by women in the past, present and, I am certain, in the challenging future which lies ahead.
Christmas Broadcast 1975
Then Christmas comes, and once again we are reminded that people matter, and it is our relationship with one another that is most important.
The Queen's Christmas Broadcast in 1975 was broadcast from the gardens of Buckingham Palace; it was the first time the message had been recorded out of doors.
It was a year of record inflation and unemployment in the UK and worldwide, to which The Queen refers.
Every year I have this special opportunity of wishing you a happy Christmas.
I like to think I am speaking to each child who can see or hear me, each woman, each man in every country of the Commonwealth.
Christmas is a festival which brings us together in small groups, a family group if we are lucky.
Today we are not just nameless people in a crowd.
We meet as friends who are glad to be together and who care about each other's happiness.
Nowadays this is a precious experience.
So much of the time we feel that our lives are dominated by great impersonal forces beyond our control, the scale of things and organisations seems to get bigger and more inhuman.
We are horrified by brutal and senseless violence, and above all the whole fabric of our lives is threatened by inflation, the frightening sickness of the world today.
Then Christmas comes, and once again we are reminded that people matter, and it is our relationship with one another that is most important.
For most of us - I wish it could be for everyone - this is a holiday, and I think it's worth reminding ourselves why.
We are celebrating a birthday - the birthday of a child born nearly 2,000 years ago, who grew up and lived for only about 30 years.
That one person, by his example and by his revelation of the good which is in us all, has made an enormous difference to the lives of people who have come to understand his teaching.
His simple message of love has been turning the world upside down ever since.
He showed that what people are and what they do, does matter and does make all the difference.
He commanded us to love our neighbours as we love ourselves, but what exactly is meant by 'loving ourselves'?
I believe it means trying to make the most of the abilities we have been given, it means caring for our talents.
It is a matter of making the best of ourselves, not just doing the best for ourselves.
We are all different, but each of us has his own best to offer.
The responsibility for the way we live life with all its challenges, sadness and joy is ours alone.
If we do this well, it will also be good for our neighbours.
If you throw a stone into a pool, the ripples go on spreading outwards.
A big stone can cause waves, but even the smallest pebble changes the whole pattern of the water.
Our daily actions are like those ripples, each one makes a difference, even the smallest.
It does matter therefore what each individual does each day.
Kindness, sympathy, resolution, and courteous behaviour are infectious.
Acts of courage and self-sacrifice, like those of the people who refuse to be terrorised by kidnappers or hijackers, or who defuse bombs, are an inspiration to others.
And the combined effect can be enormous.
If enough grains of sand are dropped into one side of a pair of scales they will, in the end, tip it against a lump of lead.
We may feel powerless alone but the joint efforts of individuals can defeat the evils of our time.
Together they can create a stable, free and considerate society.
Like those grains of sand, they can tip the balance.
So take heart from the Christmas message and be happy.
Fairmont Hotel in Vancouver, Canada, 7 October 2002
Je chéris ma place dans la vie du Canada et mon lien avec tous les Canadiens et Canadiennes.
Prime Minister, Premier, Ladies and Gentlemen,Thank you Prime Minister for your kind words.
Since 1951, the year before I became your Queen, I have made twenty-two journeys to Canada.
Of the cities Prince Philip and I have visited most often, Vancouver occupies a special place as we have come here six times.
We have always been made to feel most welcome, and we are grateful to you all for inviting us back to British Columbia in this my Golden Jubilee year.
Over the years my family and I have met both people who have lived here on the West coast for many generations and those who have arrived more recently.
Whether you are of a First Nations community, with roots in this fertile land that reach back a thousand years - or of more recent European, Asian or wider Pacific Rim origin - it is the people of British Columbia who make this such a vibrant and exciting place in which to live and work in today's borderless economy.
Vous êtes le reflet d'un Canada riche de sa diversité culturelle.
Aborder les enjeux d'immigration, façonner un sentiment d'identité, encourager les traditions culturelles, rendre hommage aux différences religieuses, ethniques et linguistiques, voilà les défis du vingt-et-unième siècle pour tous les pays.
Ici, en Colombie-Britannique, comme partout ailleurs au Canada, vous êtes les artisans d'un modèle de société multiculturelle à offrir au reste du monde.
In doing so you are constantly redefining your national identity, what it means to be a Canadian - something of particular importance to my family.
I am told of a story about my mother during her visit to Canada in 1939.
My father and mother were scheduled to visit a veterans' hospital in the province of Quebec during their six week tour.
Two Boer War veterans, both of Scots heritage, argued for weeks before my parents' arrival.
One said "She was born in Scotland, so I say she's Scots".
The other said "She married an English man, so I say she's English".
They decided to let Queen Elizabeth settle their cultural differences.
When the two were presented to Her Majesty, they asked "Are you Scots, or are you English?"
My mother paused, and then replied "Since I have landed in Quebec, I think we can say that I am a Canadian".
Mesdames et messieurs, ma mère, comme la plupart des mères, avait souvent le dernier mot.
Mais dans le cas présent, je sais exactement comment elle se sentait.
Je chéris ma place dans la vie du Canada et mon lien avec tous les Canadiens et Canadiennes.
Au cours de ces dernières cinquante années, je vous ai accompagnés célébrant avec vous les Réussites, relevant avec vous les défis.
Over these years I have watched with admiration as familiar European traditions have been enriched by the deep, spiritual cultures of the First Nations and by the entrepreneurial and artistic flair of newer communities, coming together in mutual respect against the breathtaking, wide-open backdrop of the land itself to produce a particular Canadian genius for altruistic openness and reconciliation, for enterprise and creativity.
As we "stand on guard" in these opening years of the twenty-first century, I see a Canada which is a much respected global player, a major economic force, a valued Commonwealth leader, a great country.
It is therefore with special pride that I take this opportunity during my Jubilee year to pay tribute to Canadians everywhere and to thank you for the support and affection you have given to me over these past fifty years.
Visit to Potsdam, German State Visit, 3 November 2004
I am pleased that Britain continues to play an active role in promoting Brandenburg's prosperity.
Mr.
Minister-President, Ladies and Gentlemen,Thank you for your kind words of welcome and it is a great pleasure to be in Potsdam again.
My visit here in 1992 was the first time I had seen the new Federal States.
I said then how much I admired the determination of the people in the East as they faced a difficult transition.
On my return today I would like to pay tribute to all that you have achieved.
Multi-party democracy and the rule of law are firmly established again, and so too is the free market economy.
Of course challenges remain.
We both are facing the need to continue the process of economic reform, which is never easy.
I am pleased that Britain continues to play an active role in promoting Brandenburg's prosperity.
This is not new, as my visit this afternoon to the former Crown Estate at Bornstedt will remind us.
A hundred years ago my great, great aunt and her husband developed the Crown Estate into a model of English gardening.
In the early nineteenth century British know-how helped to enrich the agricultural landscape here.
Today I shall see how a British company, Rolls Royce Aeroengines, is helping to enhance the area's reputation as a location for high-technology industry.
Other major British companies have also invested here, drawn by the skills of the people of Brandenburg and their readiness to embrace new technologies.
Mr.
Minister President, this morning I opened a conference on climate change at the British Embassy involving leading British and German scientists, politicians, and others.
The conference is evidence of British and German leadership in the field of climate change which has its roots in the close co-operation already existing between the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and the Tyndall Centre in Britain.
A speech delivered by The Duke of Sussex at The Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy Dedication in Malawi
As The Queen’s Commonwealth Youth Ambassador, I am particularly proud of how this programme will create a physical legacy of Her Majesty’s leadership of the Commonwealth - not just for our generation, but for our children, and their children too.
Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen.
The UK and Malawi have been successfully working side-by-side to win the fight against the Illegal Wildlife Trade for some time.
From tackling poachers on the ground, to sentencing in the courts, this work is successfully rooting out wildlife criminals at every stage, and removing the incentive by prioritising the punishment.
African Parks, Malawi’s rangers, and Britain’s military are sharing respective field skills to improve expertise in tracking, information analysis, bush craft and patrol skills.
This is one of the many examples of how our countries and key stakeholders can work together in partnership, with shared value and purpose.
Anyone who puts themselves in harm’s way while serving their country should be hugely appreciated.
And now, it’s time for me to welcome Liwonde National Park and Mangochi Forest Reserve to The Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy – or QCC.
I want to thank the Government of Malawi for their vision and commitment to preserving these precious assets; which they continue to prove brings more opportunity to the Malawian people.
The QCC was launched by my grandmother in 2015, and already almost 50 countries have taken part – dedicating indigenous forests for conservation, or committing to planting millions of trees.
It is so inspiring that the Commonwealth family has joined forces to save one of the world’s most important natural habitats.
As The Queen’s Commonwealth Youth Ambassador, I am particularly proud of how this programme will create a physical legacy of Her Majesty’s leadership of the Commonwealth - not just for our generation, but for our children, and their children too.
It is now therefore my pleasure to welcome the QCC’s two newest members, Liwonde National Park and Mangochi Forest.

Christmas Broadcast 1998
Though we each lead different lives, the experience of growing older, and the joys and emotions which it brings, are familiar to us all.
The Queen's Christmas Broadcast in 1998 focused on the lessons to be learnt by different generations from each other.
The broadcast included film of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother visiting the Field of Remembrance at Westminster Abbey, The Queen at Ypres and in Paris, and the reception for The Prince of Wales's 50th birthday.
Christmas is a time for reflection and renewal.
For Christians the year's end has a special and familiar significance, but all faiths have their calendars, their sign-posts, which ask us to pause from time to time and think further than the hectic daily round.
We do that as individuals, with our families, and as members of our local communities.
It is not always easy for those in their teens or twenties to believe that someone of my age - of the older generation - might have something useful to say to them.
But I would say that my mother has much to say to me.
Indeed, her vigour and enjoyment of life is a great example of how to close the so-called generation gap.
She has an extraordinary capacity to bring happiness into other people's lives.
And her own vitality and warmth is returned to her by those whom she meets.
But there are many of my mother's generation still with us.
They can remember the First World War.
Prince Philip and I can recall only the Second.
I know that those memories of ours define us as old, but they are shared with millions of others, in Britain and the Commonwealth, people who often feel forgotten by the march of time.
They remember struggles unknown to young people today, and which they will not forget.
Nor should their countries forget them.
Memories such as these are a consequence of age, and not a virtue in themselves.
But with age does come experience and that can be a virtue if it is sensibly used.
Though we each lead different lives, the experience of growing older, and the joys and emotions which it brings, are familiar to us all.
It is hard to believe that a half century has passed since our son Charles was christened, and now, last month, he has celebrated his fiftieth birthday.
It was a moment of great happiness and pride on our part in all he has achieved during the last three decades.
As a daughter, a mother and a grandmother, I often find myself seeking advice, or being asked for it, in all three capacities.
No age group has a monopoly of wisdom, and indeed I think the young can sometimes be wiser than us.
But the older I get, the more conscious I become of the difficulties young people have to face as they learn to live in the modern world.
We parents and grandparents must learn to trust our children and grandchildren as they seize their opportunities, but we can, at the same time, caution and comfort if things go wrong, or guide and explain if we are needed.
My own grandchildren and their generation have a remarkable grasp of modern technology.
They are lucky to have the freedom to travel and learn about foreign cultures at an age when the appetite for learning is keen.
I see them pushing out the boundaries of science, sport and music, of drama and discovery.
Last June Prince Philip and I gave a party for 900 of Britain's Young Achievers.
Buckingham Palace was brimming with young people who, in their short lives, have already set an example to us all: they are living proof that the timeless virtues of honesty, integrity, initiative and compassion are just as important today as they have ever been.
We hear much of 'public life' - the hurly-burly of Parliament, the media, big business, city life.
But for most people their contribution, at whatever age, is made quietly through their local communities just like so many of those Young Achievers.
To most of them, service is its own reward.
Their 'public life' is their church, their school, their sports club, their local council.
My work, and the work of my family, takes us every week into that quiet sort of 'public life', where millions of people give their time, unpaid and usually unsung, to the community, and indeed to those most at risk of exclusion from it.
We see these volunteers at work in organisations such as the Scouts and Guides, the Cadet Force, the Red Cross and St. John's, The Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme and The Prince's Trust.
These organisations, and those who serve them so selflessly, provide the bridges across which the generations travel, meet and learn from one another.
They give us, with our families, our sense of belonging.
It is they that help define our sense of duty.
It is they that can make us strong as individuals, and keep the nation's heartbeat strong and steady too.
Christmas is a good time for us to recognise all that they do for us and to say a heartfelt thank you to each and every one of them.
Official commemoration of the 60th anniversary of D-Day in France, 6 June 2004
The sixtieth anniversary of the Normandy Landings is a moment for thanksgiving, and a moment of commemoration.
Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,The invasion of France in 1944 was one of the most dramatic military operations in history.
It would have been difficult enough for a single nation to plan and execute such an enterprise; for a group of allies with little previous experience in co-operation, it was a major triumph.
The operation itself was a resounding success, but it was only achieved with the sacrifice of many courageous and determined allied Servicemen, including a large number of your Canadian colleagues, who landed here with you on Juno Beach.
Britain had been directly threatened by the enemy but you came across the Atlantic from the relative security of your homeland to fight for the freedom of Europe.
For Canadians, involved in the fight from its earliest months, the raid on Dieppe was a tragedy but, in retrospect, the lessons learned there proved to be life-savers for many thousands when you came to land in Normandy.
Malgré la distance entre le Canada et la Normandie, les liens entre Canadiens et Français sont très étroits.
Les générations futures de Canadiens de toutes origines auront raison d'être fières de l'immense contribution de l'armée et des forces navales et de l'air canadiennes pour la libération de l'Europe.
The sixtieth anniversary of the Normandy Landings is a moment for thanksgiving, and a moment of commemoration.
Today we honour all those who gave their lives in this campaign, and all of you who fought in this great struggle.
I know that present and future generations join me in thanking all Canadians who took part in this great venture.
A message from The Queen to the people of Canada (written in French)
C’est un plaisir pour moi de transmettre mes meilleurs voeux et mes félicitations aux Canadiens et Canadiennes à l’occasion du 150e anniversaire de la ConfédérationC’est un plaisir pour moi de transmettre mes meilleurs voeux et mes félicitations aux Canadiens et Canadiennes à l’occasion du 150e anniversaire de la Confédération.
Au sein du Commonwealth et ailleurs dans le monde, les nations partagent votre joie alors que vous entamez cette année toute spéciale.
Au fil des ans, et en particulier depuis votre centenaire, j’ai vu le Canada devenir une nation remarquable et se démarquer en tant que pays accueillant, respectueux et bienveillant.
Il y a maintenant cinquante ans, à la veille des célébrations du centenaire, j’ai prié les Canadiens de continuer à donner l’exemple en incarnant les valeurs d’égalité, de liberté et d’inclusion.
Aujourd’hui, ces valeurs demeurent ancrées dans l’expérience canadienne.
Vous formez encore un pays jeune, mais vous avez déjà toute la maturité voulue pour suivre votre vocation.
Au cours de la prochaine année, vous aurez l’occasion de rappeler au monde l’importance de préserver ces valeurs et de les transmettre aux futures générations.
En cette veille des célébrations nationales, ma famille et moi vous accompagnons en pensées.
Nous prions Dieu de bénir le Canada et nous souhaitons aux Canadiens de continuer à bâtir un pays et un monde toujours meilleurs.
State Visit, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil, 7 March 2006
I have vivid and happy memories of my visit to Brazil with Prince Philip in 1968, especially the warmth and hospitality of the Brazilian people.
Mr.
President,I am delighted to welcome you and Senhora Lula da Silva to London.
This is your third visit to the United Kingdom, and it is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to greet you on this State Visit.
I have vivid and happy memories of my visit to Brazil with Prince Philip in 1968, especially the warmth and hospitality of the Brazilian people and the marvellous, ambitious capital that is Brasilia.
During The Prince of Wales's more recent visit to Brazil in 2002, he saw both the beauty of the cerrado region in Tocantins, the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, and the efforts to reduce poverty and to promote the protection of the environment.
There is no doubt that during the past few years Brazil's development has caught the world's attention and admiration.
Amidst all this change one constant theme has been the steady growth in the relationship between our two countries.
We meet as good friends and allies with a common history extending back over two centuries.
Brazil's economic and infrastructure development bears an unmistakeable British stamp and we remain partners in building prosperity, with British companies active in Brazil and Brazilian counterparts making the most of opportunities here.
We have also been friends in troubled times.
British and Brazilian soldiers fought alongside each other in the Second World War, sharing a common vision of the sanctity of democracy and the rule of law.
We salute your countrymen who today are in Haiti working to uphold peace and democracy.
It is no surprise therefore that the United Kingdom and Brazil are working increasingly closely on the international stage, including at the United Nations, in areas such as tackling poverty and combating climate change, to the benefit of all of our citizens.
I am glad that the discussions last year at Gleneagles on these issues were able to draw on Your Excellency's personal leadership in the global fight against poverty.
But it is not just at government level that our friendship flourishes.
I am pleased that so many young Brazilians choose to study and work here, and that more British tourists are now travelling to Brazil.
There is no doubt that Brazilian culture is playing an increasingly lively role in Britain.
There is growing interest and appreciation, not just in your music and literature, but also your cinema, fashion and food.
I hope that the traffic is two-way: I am pleased to hear that the British Council last year celebrated sixty years in Brazil - and not surprised to learn that the Rolling Stones can still gather a crowd on Copacabana beach.
Over the next six years, the people of two of our greatest cities, Rio de Janeiro and London, will both have the experience of hosting major sporting events - the Pan American Games and the Olympic Games respectively.
And all this is without mentioning our shared national passion for football.
Mr President, your visit allows us to draw attention to the excellent relationship at all levels and in all walks of life between the United Kingdom and Brazil.
Your country is a key emerging power, and it matters to us all that Brazil continues to develop in a way that balances economic growth, the protection of the natural environment, and the promotion of good governance.
It is therefore a great pleasure to be able to welcome you on this State Visit.
Our friendship which we celebrate this evening is of great importance to us now and will be of increasing consequence to the people of both our countries in the future.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I ask you all to rise and drink a toast to:
Opening the new Churchill Museum in London, 10 February 2005
It was the unique quality of his leadership that so inspired the British nation and free peoples throughout the world.
Ladies and Gentlemen,I am very pleased to be able to visit today the Cabinet War Rooms, the scene of Sir Winston Churchill's "Finest Hour".
During those wartime years Churchill's determination and example gave us all the hope, the courage and the confidence to "tread safely into the unknown".
It was the unique quality of his leadership that so inspired the British nation and free peoples throughout the world, as well as those suffering under Nazi occupation.
That quality continues to inspire us today and should forever do so.
It is all the more surprising that until now there has been no museum dedicated to this great statesman in this country of his birth.
It seems fitting therefore, in the year in which we commemorate the fortieth anniversary of his death and the sixtieth anniversary of the victory which he did so much to bring about, that this is put right by the creation of this great new museum set in his historic wartime headquarters in the heart of Westminster.
This will fill a gap in our nation's heritage and will provide an invaluable source of learning for people of all ages, of present and future generations.
A speech by The Queen at the Russian State Banquet, 2003
Russia has established itself as our partner and our friend.
Mr.
President,It is a great pleasure for me to welcome you and Mrs. Putina to London.
By coming here you give Prince Philip and me a chance to repay the generous hospitality given to us on my State Visit to Russia in 1994, and to underline once more the close friendship between our two countries.
Our ties extend far back into history.
This year is a particularly appropriate one for your visit as it sees the 450th anniversary of Richard Chancellor's voyage, when he set out from England to establish a trading route to the East, landed near Archangel, made his way to Moscow and was presented to Tsar Ivan IV, an occasion which marked the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries.
Since then this relationship has grown in importance to us both through good times and bad.
Those of my generation in Britain have special cause to remember the unimaginable sacrifice the Russian people made to defeat fascism in the Second World War.
Nothing - not even the fact that our countries became estranged in the war's aftermath - has ever dimmed our memory of the scale of your loss.
That experience should continue to inspire us as we seek to build a more peaceful and secure world.
When I visited your country in 1994, I recall saying to President Yeltsin that he and I had spent most of our lives believing such a visit could never happen, and that I hoped he was as delighted as I was to be proved wrong.
I am just as delighted now, nine years later, to be able to welcome you here and to learn about the great changes which have occurred in your country since I was there.
Russia has established itself as our partner and our friend: we work together bilaterally and on the international stage, and we are developing new links all the time, in fields of commerce, culture, and counter-terrorism, of energy, education, the environment.
I know you will be seeing evidence of some of this during your visit.
Mr President, it is I believe a sign of genuine friendship that we are able to have disagreements but remain firm partners.
It is no secret that there were significant differences between our two countries earlier this year on how best to handle Iraq.
But we are now able to look forward together, firmly in agreement on the route we have decided in the United Nations, although the tragic loss of British lives today reminds us all of the difficulties to be faced.
But as we look ahead we know that our long-term partnership is of profound importance to both of us.
This is clearly evident if we look beyond the challenges of international politics.
In the last few months alone we have heard the announcements of major investments in Russia by British companies; we have also heard a different sound - of Sir Paul McCartney playing to enthusiastic crowds in Red Square; and we in turn have been enthralled by the celebrations of the tercentenary of your own city, St. Petersburg.
At the same time, work continues to bring the young people of our countries closer together, through language teaching, school exchanges and university programmes.
We have a vibrant and exciting relationship, from which we both derive immense benefit.
Mr.
President, your country is rich in culture and history.
But it is also rich in potential; that of your people and your natural resources.
You personally have been energetic and determined in promoting reform in Russia.
In particular, your dedication to the task of reforming and strengthening Russia's economy, so improving the quality of life for ordinary Russians, wins our real admiration.
We support your efforts to create a modern, prosperous and dynamic state, and we look forward to working with you on this and on many international questions on the basis of our shared values.
My message to you, Mr President, is therefore one of admiration, respect and support.
I wish both you and Mrs. Putina a most successful and enjoyable visit to this country.
Christmas Broadcast 2007
The Christmas story also draws attention to all those people who are on the edge of society The Queen's Christmas Broadcast of 2007 focused on supporting the disadvantaged as well as family members at Christmas.
One of the features of growing old is a heightened awareness of change.
To remember what happened 50 years ago means that it is possible to appreciate what has changed in the meantime.
It also makes you aware of what has remained constant.
In my experience, the positive value of a happy family is one of the factors of human existence that has not changed.
The immediate family of grandparents, parents and children, together with their extended family, is still the core of a thriving community.
When Prince Philip and I celebrated our Diamond Wedding last month, we were much aware of the affection and support of our own family as they gathered round us for the occasion.
Now today, of course, marks the birth of Jesus Christ.
Among other things, it is a reminder that it is the story of a family; but of a family in very distressed circumstances.
Mary and Joseph found no room at the inn; they had to make do in a stable, and the new-born Jesus had to be laid in a manger.
This was a family which had been shut out.
Perhaps it was because of this early experience that, throughout his ministry, Jesus of Nazareth reached out and made friends with people whom others ignored or despised.
It was in this way that he proclaimed his belief that, in the end, we are all brothers and sisters in one human family.
The Christmas story also draws attention to all those people who are on the edge of society - people who feel cut off and disadvantaged; people who, for one reason or another, are not able to enjoy the full benefits of living in a civilised and law-abiding community.
For these people the modern world can seem a distant and hostile place.
It is all too easy to 'turn a blind eye', 'to pass by on the other side', and leave it to experts and professionals.
All the great religious teachings of the world press home the message that everyone has a responsibility to care for the vulnerable.
Fortunately, there are many groups and individuals, often unsung and unrewarded, who are dedicated to ensuring that the 'outsiders' are given a chance to be recognised and respected.
However, each one of us can also help by offering a little time, a talent or a possession, and taking a share in the responsibility for the well-being of those who feel excluded.
And also today I want to draw attention to another group of people who deserve our thoughts this Christmas.
We have all been conscious of those who have given their lives, or who have been severely wounded, while serving with the Armed Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The dedication of the National Armed Forces Memorial was also an occasion to remember those who have suffered while serving in these and every other place of unrest since the end of the Second World War.
For their families, Christmas will bring back sad memories, and I pray that all of you, who are missing those who are dear to you, will find strength and comfort in your families and friends.
A familiar introduction to an annual Christmas Carol Service contains the words: 'Because this would most rejoice his heart, let us remember, in his name, the poor and the helpless, the cold, the hungry, and the oppressed; the sick and those who mourn, the lonely and the unloved.'
State Banquet, Buckingham Palace, President of Poland, 5 May 2004
We both look forward with optimism as partners working closely together for a stronger more effective Europe.
Mr.
President, Ladies and Gentlemen,I am delighted to welcome you, Mr President, and Madame Kwasniewska to London today.
Prince Philip and I were very pleased to visit Poland eight years ago early in your Presidency, and it is a great pleasure to be able to return your hospitality on this occasion.
This State Visit is well timed.
This week Poland has taken the momentous step of joining the European Union.
For most of my own reign, Europe has been cruelly and unnaturally divided.
Those divisions have ended, not least thanks to Poland's particular determination and fortitude.
The moderate, generous approach taken through those difficult years by His Holiness Pope John Paul II has set a much admired example.
More recently Mr. President, your own role in leading your country to join NATO and now the European Union has been exceptional.
Poland is once again able to play its full part in shaping our shared European destiny.
Soon Europe's political leaders are to decide how the enlarged European Union can function more effectively.
It is worth recalling Poland's distinctive historical contribution to this shared democratic convention.
Poland's Constitution of 1791 was the first constitution in Europe to articulate a democratic balancing of powers.
The philosopher Edmund Burke described it as a 'happy wonder'.
Through so many painful years thereafter, the commitment of Poland and its people to the European ideals of freedom, democracy and peace was sorely tested.
When Prince Philip and I paid our State Visit to your country in 1996, I laid wreaths in memory of those who fell in the terrible battle for Warsaw in 1944 sixty years ago.
Last year was the sixtieth anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising in which so many Jews showed indomitable courage in fighting for freedom, tragically paying for it with their lives.
It is right to remember those who fought and fell to give us the chance to enjoy our freedom today.
It is right to celebrate today those from our two countries who took that chance and built a better future.
As we both know only too well, peace and freedom cannot be taken for granted.
Europe's division has ended, but new enemies of liberty have emerged.
Our two countries have been standing alongside each other in Bosnia and now Iraq, giving the people in these troubled countries a chance to build a better life.
These examples and so many more show that we are two similar countries, who share many of the same instincts, have a common history and now go forward as partners in a common future.
Today trade between our two nations is thriving.
Our close cultural links continue to flourish.
Every year thousands of students study with the British Council in Poland and around twenty-five of the brightest and the best come here on a Chevening scholarship to pursue their postgraduate studies, helping to foster future ties.
Tonight we both look back with pride on our achievements in forging Europe's history down the centuries.
And we both look forward with optimism as partners working closely together for a stronger more effective Europe.
Poland is back where it belongs: a leading member of the family of free and democratic European nations.
Poland and the United Kingdom are old friends in this new Europe.
Where better than to celebrate here in London tonight?Mr.
President, I warmly welcome you both to this country.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I ask you all to raise your glasses to:
Jamaican Parliament, 19 February 2002
The Commonwealth remains one of the strongest pillars for the building of world-wide peace, growth and development.
Madam President, Madam Speaker:I thank you on behalf of Prince Philip and myself for your kind words of welcome.
We are both delighted to be back here on this our sixth visit to Jamaica.
It is a very special pleasure for me, on the occasion of my Golden Jubilee, to address the Jamaican Parliament, the first of the independent Parliaments in the Caribbean.
As Jamaica prepares this year to mark the fortieth anniversary of Independence, it is fitting to reflect both on your contribution during these past years to the strengthening of the Commonwealth and on your potential in the years ahead for further growth and influence within the organisation.
Fifty years ago, the world was indeed a very different place.
It is a cause for celebration that during the second half of the last century, in so many countries across the world, people have reaped the benefits of increased national consciousness and self-determination.
As sovereign states you have not only taken responsibility for your own national progress but have become ever more conscious of your collective responsibility for the sustainability and development of our planet.
For with independence has come interdependence.
The terrible events of September 11th last year reminded us with tragic forcefulness that we do not exist simply as individual countries or even as large international political alliances.
We are more than ever part of a global network and the impact of international events in our modern world on any one of us is to a greater or lesser extent felt by all of us.
I am convinced that, as we face the challenges of today, in particular on the economic and social fronts, the Commonwealth remains one of the strongest pillars for the building of world-wide peace, growth and development.
We pride ourselves on our acceptance of the rule of law, our preference for diplomatic solutions to international problems and our willingness to support one another in our respective development strategies.
This Parliament has been one of the significant institutions for the fashioning and strengthening of your democratic society.
It has created many important laws to protect the rights of citizens and to promote Jamaica's effective participation in the global economy through international trade.
In recent years you have opened up your deliberations to make your procedures more accessible to the public.
It is also encouraging that the government has sought to engage civil society more actively in the process of governance.
The warmth of the people of Jamaica has always been much in evidence during our visits here.
It is the same generosity of the Jamaican spirit which provides you as Parliament and Government with the energy and the will to serve and to lead.
And I believe that this country can be justly proud of the outstanding contribution you have made to so many areas of international life.
In the fields of scholarship, music and the arts, in the world of sports and in the arena of international political dialogue, Jamaicans have continually excelled over many years.
It is right to protect this heritage which has served you so well and which has allowed the talents and creative energies of Jamaicans to blossom and flourish.
It is equally important to seek out new ways of drawing in all members of the society to ensure that every Jamaican enjoys equal opportunities for the fulfilment of their dreams and aspirations.
I commend you for the initiatives you are taking to support the family, protect the young and strengthen the social fabric of this country.
Prince Philip and I have a unique opportunity to see and hear about these ways in which you are meeting the challenge of giving every Jamaican a stake in the future during our short visit in this year which marks both Jamaica's fortieth anniversary of Independence and my Golden Jubilee.
Such anniversaries are important.
They are, I hope, opportunities to celebrate and, in so doing, to bring people and communities together.
They are also moments to reflect on what has gone before and to rededicate ourselves with determination and confidence to all that lies ahead.
Above all they are occasions to remind ourselves of the honour, the pride and the pleasure of giving service to this country and Jamaicans everywhere.
A speech by The Queen at the Ghana State Banquet, 2007
Ghana today is a progressive, open society.
The economy is buoyant, and growth and prosperity are being fostered by a pluralistic and lively political debate and by your responsible and forward-looking development policies.
Mr President,I am delighted to welcome you and Mrs Kufuor to London.
I know that you are a frequent visitor to the United Kingdom, but it is a pleasure to be able to greet you on this State Visit just a week after you welcomed the world to Ghana to celebrate the Fiftieth Anniversary of your independence.
Tonight we too can celebrate this happy milestone with you and the Ghanaian people.
Fifty years ago, Ghana became the first sub-Saharan African country to gain its independence.
Expectations and optimism were high as a new and ambitious nation was born.
Looking back at those fifty years this evening, we can see that, despite reverses encountered along the way, the expectations and optimism were well based, for they were founded upon the character and the dynamism of the Ghanaian people.
Ghana today is a progressive, open society.
The economy is buoyant, and growth and prosperity are being fostered by a pluralistic and lively political debate and by your responsible and forward-looking development policies.
These have allowed Ghana to benefit from very substantial development cooperation and debt cancellation; they promise to make a reality of your vision of Ghana as the Gateway to West Africa.
We applaud your commitment to the rule of law, your stand against corruption, and the priority you attach to investment in basic social services.
These underline your determination to leave a legacy of Ghana as an increasingly stable, transparent and prosperous nation with a healthier, more skilled population.
Ghana plays a positive and forward-looking role in the region and beyond.
As a member of the United Nations Security Council you have worked hard to advance the cause of peace.
I am sure, as the newly chosen African Union Chairman, you will champion African stability and development.
As a prominent and active member of the Economic Community of West African States, you have sought solutions to the conflicts that beset Africa.
Your armed forces demonstrate that your commitment goes beyond words, with Ghanaian soldiers deployed in peace support operations from Liberia to Darfur, from Côte d'Ivoire to Lebanon, and I would like to pay tribute tonight to the contribution made by the distinguished Ghanaian, Kofi Annan, to international peace.
It gives me great pride that the United Kingdom has played - and continues to play - such a supportive role in Ghana, as equal Commonwealth partners, working together in the many areas where our values and aspirations coincide.
Ours is a forward-looking partnership and, as we mark the completion of Ghana's first half-century, we look forward to accompanying you on the journey of the next fifty years.
Mr President, our histories and our people have long been woven together, and that has never been truer than today.
This is a source of strength for both nations, through the British presence in Ghana, and through the enormous contribution to British life made by the large, talented and active Ghanaian community in the United Kingdom.
In every field, from the media to finance, from commerce to football, Ghanaians are present, and making their mark.
Of course, many challenges face us as we prepare for the next fifty years and as new threats to peace and prosperity emerge.
But in our ever-changing world, I believe one thing is certain.
As Ghana moves to face these challenges, she can rely on the United Kingdom as a strong supporter, a dependable partner and a loyal friend.
Lunch at the Hotel Matignon, Paris, 6 April 2004
I ask you to join me in a toast to the French Republic, to the President and to the prosperity of its regions and cities.
Mr.
Prime Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen,I am most grateful to you for inviting me here to lunch.
I am glad to see around this table so many distinguished representatives from the countries, regions and cities of France and the United Kingdom.
I know, Mr. Prime Minister, that you and your government have placed particular emphasis on the importance of giving local authorities as much ability as possible to manage their own affairs.
In Britain we have also seen a devolution of powers to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the presence of whose representatives I warmly welcome here today.
Relations between France and the United Kingdom are so much more than relations between capitals and central governments.
I hope that contacts made and partnerships strengthened here today can help make a new reality of friendship between the countries, regions and cities of our two nations.
Mr.
Prime Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen, may I ask you to join me in a toast to the French Republic, to the President and to the prosperity of its regions and cities.
French versionMonsieur le Premier ministre, Mesdames, Messieurs,Je vous suis très reconnaissante de me recevoir à ce déjeuner.
Je me réjouis de voir autour de cette table tant de dignitaires des contrées, régions et villes de France et du Royaume-Uni.
Je sais, Monsieur le Premier ministre, que votre gouvernement et vous-même avez à coeur de donner aux collectivités locales le plus de marge de manoeuvre que possible pour la conduite de leurs affaires.
En Grande-Bretagne aussi, nous avons décentralisé les pouvoirs, pour donner plus d'autonomie à l'Écosse, au pays de Galles et à l'Irlande du Nord, dont je salue chaleureusement les représentants présents aujourd'hui.
Les relations entre la France et le Royaume-Uni vont beaucoup plus loin que de simples relations entre capitales et administrations centrales.
J'espère que les prises de contact et les partenariats qui vont s'établir ou se renforcer aujourd'hui contribueront à raviver les liens d'amitié entre les contrées, les régions et les villes de nos deux pays.
Christmas Broadcast 2000
By any measure this Millennium year has been an unforgettable one.
The Queen used her Christmas Broadcast at the end of the year 2000 to reflect on the true start of the new Millennium and the role of faith in communities.
The broadcast included film of that year's visit to Australia.
By any measure this Millennium year has been an unforgettable one.
Since the turn of the year it has been celebrated and marked in this country and throughout the Commonwealth, and it has been a particular pleasure for me to visit Millennium projects large and small which will be reminders for generations to come of the time when the twenty-first century began.
But as this year draws to a close I would like to reflect more directly and more personally on what lies behind all the celebrations of these past twelve months.
Christmas is the traditional, if not the actual, birthday of a man who was destined to change the course of our history.
And today we are celebrating the fact that Jesus Christ was born two thousand years ago; this is the true Millennium anniversary.
The simple facts of Jesus' life give us little clue as to the influence he was to have on the world.
As a boy he learnt his father's trade as a carpenter.
He then became a preacher, recruiting twelve supporters to help him.
But his ministry only lasted a few years and he himself never wrote anything down.
In his early thirties he was arrested, tortured and crucified with two criminals.
His death might have been the end of the story, but then came the resurrection and with it the foundation of the Christian faith.
Even in our very material age the impact of Christ's life is all around us.
If you want to see an expression of Christian faith you have only to look at our awe-inspiring cathedrals and abbeys, listen to their music, or look at their stained glass windows, their books and their pictures.
But the true measure of Christ's influence is not only in the lives of the saints but also in the good works quietly done by millions of men and women day in and day out throughout the centuries.
Many will have been inspired by Jesus' simple but powerful teaching: love God and love thy neighbour as thyself - in other words, treat others as you would like them to treat you.
His great emphasis was to give spirituality a practical purpose.
Whether we believe in God or not, I think most of us have a sense of the spiritual, that recognition of a deeper meaning and purpose in our lives, and I believe that this sense flourishes despite the pressures of our world.
This spirituality can be seen in the teachings of other great faiths.
Of course religion can be divisive, but the Bible, the Koran and the sacred texts of the Jews and Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs, are all sources of divine inspiration and practical guidance passed down through the generations.
To many of us our beliefs are of fundamental importance.
For me the teachings of Christ and my own personal accountability before God provide a framework in which I try to lead my life.
I, like so many of you, have drawn great comfort in difficult times from Christ's words and example.
I believe that the Christian message, in the words of a familiar blessing, remains profoundly important to us all:"Go forth into the world in peace,
	be of good courage,
	hold fast that which is good,
	render to no man evil for evil,
	strengthen the faint-hearted,
	support the weak,
	help the afflicted,
	honour all men.
"It is a simple message of compassion... and yet as powerful as ever today, two thousand years after Christ's birth.
The Queen's speech at the Spanish State Banquet
This State Visit is an expression of the deep respect and friendship that describes relations between Spain and the United KingdomYour Majesty,The Duke of Edinburgh and I are delighted to welcome you and Queen Letizia to Buckingham Palace this evening.
This State Visit is an expression of the deep respect and friendship that describes relations between Spain and the United Kingdom.
Just occasionally, a State Visit can provide an opportunity for great personal happiness also.
So it was, more than a century ago, when your great-grandfather, King Alfonso the Thirteenth, met his future wife, Princess Victoria Eugenie, the grand-daughter of our Queen Victoria, in this very ballroom.
The new Queen of Spain cemented strong ties between us, a link honoured by the service in the Royal Navy of your grandfather, Don Juan, Count of Barcelona.
Prince Philip and I recall with affection the State Visit of 1986 made by your parents, during which King Juan Carlos addressed both Houses of Parliament.
His Majesty was the first foreign monarch ever to do so, which was a tribute to his role in Spain’s transition to democracy and acknowledgment that he was a King for all Spaniards.
Your father spoke proudly about Your Majesty that day.
You had just come of age, swearing loyalty in your Parliament to the Spanish Constitution.
These years later, those duties are now yours, supporting Spain’s thriving democracy.
It is therefore altogether fitting that Your Majesty, too, has addressed our Houses of Parliament today.
The relationship between our two nations is dynamic and modern.
We are NATO allies, striving together to improve security in Europe and across the globe.
Our armed forces are currently working side by side in the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, led last year by Spain and now by the United Kingdom.
We remain deeply committed to the common defence and freedom of our countries.
There are so many facets to our shared experiences and close connections.
Indeed, the lives of our peoples themselves are more intertwined than ever before.
Thousands of Spanish students are studying at British universities, and Spanish scientists are working with British colleagues to tackle disease.
We are also significant investors in each other’s economies, with the United Kingdom being the principal European recipient of Spanish overseas investment.
A relationship like ours, founded on such great strengths and common interests, will ensure that both our nations prosper, now and in the future, whatever challenges arise.
With such a remarkable shared history, it is inevitable that there are matters on which we have not always seen eye to eye.
But the strength of our friendship has bred a resilient spirit of cooperation and goodwill.
Your Majesty, our countries are reliable partners and friends.
We deeply appreciate the significant contribution that Spain continues to make to this country and assure you of our enduring friendship in the future.
Visit to Jersey to mark the 60th anniversary of Liberation, 9 May 2005
I am pleased that so many people are present today for whom the 9th of May has such a personal significance.
Mr. Bailiff,I thank you all for the warm welcome you have given Prince Philip and me on this special day for the Channel Islands.
I am pleased that so many people are present today for whom the 9th of May has such a personal significance.
Many of you have vivid recollections of the celebrations in this very place sixty years ago; others have different memories, of evacuation before the Occupation, of deportation during the war, or of volunteering with courage to serve in the armed forces.
None of us, young or old, should allow ourselves to forget the sacrifices and the suffering of those long years, but I think all of us can be heartened by the efforts which have been made in recent times to promote reconciliation, tolerance and forgiveness, symbolised in the short drama we have just enjoyed.
Last year you celebrated the eight hundredth anniversary of Jersey's connections with the Crown.
Those links have been tested over the centuries, and never more so than during the Occupation.
I recall how impressed I was, when I first visited the Island after the war in 1949, to discover how quickly you were putting those times behind you, and I am pleased to see how the special privileges and autonomy granted to the Island by the Crown so many centuries ago have formed the basis of the successful Island in which you live today.
State Banquet, President of the United States of America, 19 November 2003
We share the confidence - and the courage - to try and make this a more prosperous, a safer, and above all a freer world.
Mr.
President, Ladies and Gentlemen,It gives me great pleasure to welcome you and Mrs. Bush to London.
Visits by American Presidents have been memorable landmarks in my reign.
Unlike in the United States, the British Head of State is not limited to two terms of four years, and I have welcomed no fewer than seven of your predecessors.
The first US President to stay in Buckingham Palace was Woodrow Wilson, in December 1918.
America had then been fighting alongside us in the First World War and was to do so again in our hour of need during the Second World War.
And at the very core of the new international and multilateral order which emerged after the shared sacrifices of that last, terrible World War was a vital, dynamic transatlantic partnership, working with other allies to create effective international institutions.
The Marshall Plan led to the beginnings of the European Union, and the establishment of NATO became the bedrock for European security.
Sixty years ago, Winston Churchill coined the term "Special Relationship" to describe the close collaboration between the United Kingdom and United States forces that was instrumental in freeing Europe from tyranny.
Despite occasional criticism of the term, I believe it admirably describes our friendship.
Like all special friends, we can talk frankly and we can disagree from time to time - even sometimes fall out over a particular issue.
But the depth and breadth of our partnership means that there is always so much we are doing together, at all levels, that disputes can be quickly overcome and forgiven.
I in my turn have had the pleasure of paying three State Visits to your country.
The last was in 1991 - the end of the Cold War.
Your father, Mr. President, was instrumental in leading the way through those heady but uncertain months from the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 to the break-up of the Soviet Union two years later.
In this twenty-first century we face together many unforeseen and formidable challenges.
The leadership you showed in the aftermath of the terrible events of 11th September 2001 won the admiration of everyone in the United Kingdom.
You led the response to an unprovoked terrorist attack which was on a scale never seen before.
Your friends in this country were amongst the very first to sense the grief and horror that struck your nation that day - and to share the slow and often painful process of recovery.
And our troops have served side by side in Afghanistan and Iraq to lead the fight to restore freedom and democracy.
Our two countries stand firm in their determination to defeat terrorism.
As we look to the future together, there are many fields in which our governments and people work alongside each other to the benefit of both nations.
The end of supersonic travel by Concorde may mean that for some it takes longer to cross the Atlantic, but in the case of the United States and the United Kingdom, the two sides of the ocean have never been closer.
Our two countries are each other's largest foreign investors, supporting millions of jobs.
In areas such as science and technology, health, urban redevelopment and law and order, our experts exchange best practice knowledge to improve the quality of life for us and for future generations.
All this is founded on our longstanding sense of common purpose, our shared values and shared interests, our deep underlying sense of respect and affection.
We are bound across the generations by much more too.
We share the confidence - and the courage - to try and make this a more prosperous, a safer, and above all a freer world.
The reason for this, Mr. President, is written in our history.
As your father said in his own inaugural address "We know what is right: freedom is right".
The Queen's Commonwealth Day Message, 10 March 2014
The understanding that we belong together, and are able, through teamwork, to achieve far more than we could do alone, has always been at the heart of our approach.
In July this year, the opening of the 20th Commonwealth Games will be marked by the arrival in Glasgow of the baton that started its journey from Buckingham Palace five months ago.
Many of us are following closely the news of the baton relay as it passes through the 70 countries and territories whose teams will gather for the Games.
The images bring vividly to life what we mean by the Commonwealth family: it is wonderful to see the warmth, shared endeavour and goodwill as the baton is passed through the hands of many thousands of people.
Affinities of history and inheritance from the past are strong, yet we are bound together by a sense that the Commonwealth is a powerful influence of good for the future.
People of all ages from different cultures are weaving an ever-growing network of links which connect us in our diversity and our common purpose.
It is this unity that is expressed in this year's theme: 'Team Commonwealth'.
While national teams will be concentrating on the competition in August, Team Commonwealth will have a longer focus, working together to achieve a more enduring success.
Experiences of life differ widely throughout the Commonwealth, and we each make contributions from sometimes very different viewpoints.
But we are committed to the same goals.
Together we offer each other encouragement and draw strength from this mutual support.
The understanding that we belong together, and are able, through teamwork, to achieve far more than we could do alone, has always been at the heart of our approach.
For all of us this is now captured in the Commonwealth Charter which sets out the values and principles which guide and motivate us.
This year, more children and young people are participating in Commonwealth Day celebrations.
Advances in technology enable us to reach a greater number of young people in schools, on-line using the 'Commonwealth Class' initiative, and through events in local communities where the Commonwealth flag is being raised.
Christmas Broadcast 2005
These natural and human tragedies provided the headline news; they also provoked a quite remarkable humanitarian response.
In the twelve months following the 2004 Christmas broadcast, the world suffered a number of terrible natural disasters, including a huge tsunami in South East Asia, a series of hurricanes in the Caribbean, disastrous floods in New Orleans, and an earthquake in Pakistan and India which killed over 70,000 people and made millions homeless.
July also saw terrorists strike in London, killing commuters.
In her Christmas Broadcast in 2005 The Queen reflected on the year's tragedies and praised the work of those involved in providing humanitarian assistance.
The day after my last Christmas message was broadcast, the world experienced one of the worst natural disasters ever recorded.
The devastating tsunami struck countries around the Indian Ocean causing death and destruction on an unprecedented scale.
This was followed by a number of vicious hurricanes across the Caribbean and the inundation of the city of New Orleans.
Then in the autumn came the massive earthquake in Pakistan and India.
This series of dreadful events has brought loss and suffering to so many people - and their families and friends - not only in the countries directly affected, but here in Britain and throughout the Commonwealth.
As if these disasters were not bad enough, I have sometimes thought that humanity seemed to have turned on itself - with wars, civil disturbances and acts of brutal terrorism.
In this country many people's lives were totally changed by the London bombings in July.
This Christmas my thoughts are especially with those everywhere who are grieving the loss of loved ones during what for so many has been such a terrible year.
These natural and human tragedies provided the headline news; they also provoked a quite remarkable humanitarian response.
People of compassion all over the world responded with immediate practical and financial help.
There may be an instinct in all of us to help those in distress, but in many cases I believe this has been inspired by religious faith.
Christianity is not the only religion to teach its followers to help others and to treat your neighbour as you would want to be treated yourself.
It has been clear that in the course of this year relief workers and financial support have come from members of every faith and from every corner of the world.
There is no doubt that the process of rebuilding these communities is far from over and there will be fresh calls on our commitment to help in the future.
Certainly the need for selflessness and generosity in the face of hardship is nothing new.
The veterans of the Second World War whom we honoured last summer can tell us how so often, in moments of greatest trial, those around them seemed able to draw on some inner strength to find courage and compassion.
We see this today in the way that young men and women are calmly serving our country around the world often in great danger.
This last year has reminded us that this world is not always an easy or a safe place to live in, but it is the only place we have.
I believe also that it has shown us all how our faith - whatever our religion - can inspire us to work together in friendship and peace for the sake of our own and future generations.
For Christians this festival of Christmas is the time to remember the birth of the one we call "the Prince of Peace" and our source of "light and life" in both good times and bad.
It is not always easy to accept his teaching, but I have no doubt that the New Year will be all the better if we do but try.
The Queen's message of condolence to the President of Turkey
Her Majesty The Queen has sent a message of condolence to the President of Turkey, following the attack in Istanbul on New Year's Day.
Our thoughts are with the families of the victims and the wounded, and with the Turkish people at this time.
Prince Philip and I were saddened to learn of the terrible attack in Istanbul on New Year's Day.
Our thoughts are with the families of the victims and the wounded, and with the Turkish people at this time.
The death of Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother, 8 April 2002
I thank you for the support you are giving me and my family as we come to terms with her death and the void she has left in our midst.
Ever since my beloved mother died over a week ago I have been deeply moved by the outpouring of affection which has accompanied her death.
My family and I always knew what she meant for the people of this country and the special place she occupied in the hearts of so many here, in the Commonwealth and in other parts of the world.
But the extent of the tribute that huge numbers of you have paid my mother in the last few days has been overwhelming.
I have drawn great comfort from so many individual acts of kindness and respect.
Over the years I have met many people who have had to cope with family loss, sometimes in the most tragic of circumstances.
So I count myself fortunate that my mother was blessed with a long and happy life.
She had an infectious zest for living, and this remained with her until the very end.
I know too that her faith was always a great strength to her.
At the ceremony tomorrow I hope that sadness will blend with a wider sense of thanksgiving, not just for her life but for the times in which she lived - a century for this country and the Commonwealth not without its trials and sorrows, but also one of extraordinary progress, full of examples of courage and service as well as fun and laughter.
This is what my mother would have understood, because it was the warmth and affection of people everywhere which inspired her resolve, dedication and enthusiasm for life.
I thank you for the support you are giving me and my family as we come to terms with her death and the void she has left in our midst.
I thank you also from my heart for the love you gave her during her life and the honour you now give her in death.
End of The Queen's UK Golden Jubilee tour, Preston, 5 August 2002
I have been profoundly moved by the affection shown and by the warmth of the response to my Golden Jubilee.
Lord-Lieutenant, Ladies and Gentlemen,Thank you for this delightful picture which will be a happy reminder of this visit.
I would like to take the opportunity of this last day of my final Jubilee Summer Tour to express my gratitude not just to you here in Preston and Lancashire but to everybody throughout the United Kingdom for the warmth of the welcome I have been given by you all during these memorable past three months.
I have been profoundly moved by the affection shown and by the warmth of the response to my Golden Jubilee.
It has been for Prince Philip and me a summer of great joy and happiness, and a celebration of all that binds us together as a nation - the heritage of our past, the values of our present and the shared challenges of the future that lies ahead.
