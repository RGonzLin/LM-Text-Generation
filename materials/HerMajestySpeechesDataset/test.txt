The Queen's speech at the US State Banquet
I am so glad that we have another opportunity to demonstrate the immense importance that both our countries attach to our relationship Mr President,I am delighted to welcome you and Mrs Trump to Buckingham Palace this evening, just twelve months after our first meeting at Windsor.
Visits by American Presidents always remind us of the close and longstanding friendship between the United Kingdom and the United States, and I am so glad that we have another opportunity to demonstrate the immense importance that both our countries attach to our relationship.
In the coming days, you will see some of our most treasured historical buildings, speak to the business leaders whose expertise and innovation drive our economies, and meet members of our Armed Services, past and present.
You will also travel to Portsmouth and Normandy to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of D-Day.
On that day – and on many occasions since – the Armed Forces of both our countries fought side-by-side to defend our cherished values of liberty and democracy.
Mr President, in your State of the Union Address this year, you paid tribute to some of the American heroes who risked their lives, and we owe an immeasurable debt to the British, American and Allied soldiers who began the liberation of Europe on 6th June 1944.
I paid my first State Visit to your country at the invitation of President Eisenhower.
As Supreme Allied Commander, he had ultimate responsibility for the execution of the Normandy landings.
In his headquarters in St James’s Square – not far from Buckingham Palace – British and American officers worked closely together to plan the freedom of a continent, and it would be no exaggeration to say that millions of lives depended on their common endeavour.
As we face the new challenges of the Twenty First Century, the anniversary of D-Day reminds us of all that our countries have achieved together.
After the shared sacrifices of the Second World War, Britain and the United States worked with other allies to build an assembly of international institutions, to ensure that the horrors of conflict would never be repeated.
While the world has changed, we are forever mindful of the original purpose of these structures: nations working together to safeguard a hard won peace.
Of course, it is not only our security which unites us; but our strong cultural links and shared heritage.
Every year, there are almost four million visits by Americans to the United Kingdom, with a great number claiming British descent.
And with your own Scottish ancestry, Mr President, you too have a particular connection to this country.
We are also bound by the strength and breadth of our economic ties, as the largest investors in each other’s economies.
British companies in the United States employ over one million Americans, and the same is true vice versa.
Mr President, as we look to the future, I am confident that our common values and shared interests will continue to unite us.
Tonight we celebrate an alliance that has helped to ensure the safety and prosperity of both our peoples for decades, and which I believe will endure for many years to come.
An address by Her Majesty The Queen on the 75th anniversary of VE Day
Never give up, never despair - that was the message of VE DayI speak to you today at the same hour as my father did, exactly 75 years ago.
His message then was a salute to the men and women at home and abroad who had sacrificed so much in pursuit of what he rightly called a “great deliverance”.
The war had been a total war; it had affected everyone, and no one was immune from its impact.
Whether it be the men and women called up to serve; families separated from each other; or people asked to take up new roles and skills to support the war effort, all had a part to play.
At the start, the outlook seemed bleak, the end distant, the outcome uncertain.
But we kept faith that the cause was right - and this belief, as my father noted in his broadcast, carried us through.
Never give up, never despair - that was the message of VE Day.
I vividly remember the jubilant scenes my sister and I witnessed with our parents and Winston Churchill from the balcony of Buckingham Palace.
The sense of joy in the crowds who gathered outside and across the country was profound, though while we celebrated the victory in Europe, we knew there would be further sacrifice.
It was not until August that fighting in the Far East ceased and the war finally ended.
Many people laid down their lives in that terrible conflict.
They fought so we could live in peace, at home and abroad.
They died so we could live as free people in a world of free nations.
They risked all so our families and neighbourhoods could be safe.
We should and will remember them.
As I now reflect on my father’s words and the joyous celebrations, which some of us experienced first-hand, I am thankful for the strength and courage that the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and all our allies displayed.
The wartime generation knew that the best way to honour those who did not come back from the war, was to ensure that it didn’t happen again.
The greatest tribute to their sacrifice is that countries who were once sworn enemies are now friends, working side by side for the peace, health and prosperity of us all.
Today it may seem hard that we cannot mark this special anniversary as we would wish.
Instead we remember from our homes and our doorsteps.
But our streets are not empty; they are filled with the love and the care that we have for each other.
And when I look at our country today, and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another, I say with pride that we are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognise and admire.
I send my warmest good wishes to you all.
Australian Prime Minister's Commonwealth Games luncheon, 15 March 2006
Australia has an enviable record at the Commonwealth Games.
Prime Minister, Ladies and GentlemenI am most grateful for your words of welcome.
It is always a pleasure to come back to the State of Victoria, which holds so many memories for me and all my family.
It is especially rewarding to return here to the wonderfully maintained Royal Exhibition Building which has connections with my family going back to when my grandfather opened the first Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901.
I subsequently was present at the Opening of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting here in 1981.I am pleased that another Commonwealth occasion brings me back today.
Sport plays an important part in the life of our organisation.
Not only does it give all our members the opportunity to come together every four years to participate in the Commonwealth Games, but it provides many other opportunities for contact between nations individually and collectively.
Australia has an enviable record at the Commonwealth Games over the years and I acknowledge today the presence of so many athletes who have made an outstanding contribution not only to Australia's success but to the strengthening of ties across the Commonwealth through their sporting endeavours.
All our countries attach increasing importance to the vital role sport has to play in building and strengthening communities.
Yesterday the Commonwealth Advisory Body on Sport met and considered such subjects as using sport to develop community leadership and participation and the health benefits that participation in sport brings.
Australia is to be commended for the energy and commitment it has brought to the deliberations of the Advisory Body and for the generous financial assistance it has provided for well over a decade now to promote the wider benefits of sport in Commonwealth countries, especially in the Pacific, southern Africa and the Caribbean.
I am much looking forward to the opening of the Commonwealth Games this evening and the days of competition that will follow.
I understand that the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which is acknowledged as one of the world's greatest sporting arenas, has been completely transformed with the construction of new grandstands and other facilities.
In a city internationally acclaimed for its love of sport, the redeveloped complex will no doubt continue to be at the centre of much of the city's sporting life.
An address by The Queen to the National Assembly for Wales, 2006
It is to the men and women of Wales that you, the members of this National Assembly, ultimately answer.
Presiding Officer, Ladies and Gentlemen,It is a great pleasure for me to be here on this memorable day for the National Assembly for Wales.
I am delighted that this important occasion has drawn on the heritage and diversity of this land to mark the opening of this fine new building.
It is a moment for the whole of Wales to celebrate.
It is fitting therefore, Presiding Officer, that you and the other Members of the National Assembly have today been joined by the Secretary of State and elected representatives of local government throughout Wales.
All elected to public office bear a heavy responsibility, as the servants of those who elect them, to give democratic voice to their aspirations, expectations and concerns.
It is to the men and women of Wales that you, the members of this National Assembly, ultimately answer.
Your new home seeks to recognise that fundamental relationship.
It emphasises the openness of democracy.
It is grounded in the earth, but reminds us of the high ideals to which public service aspires.
It is accessible and welcoming to all who visit, work in, or are elected to the National Assembly.
It is also a place which respects the stewardship of the world's environmental resources.
The participation of representatives from parliaments overseas in today's ceremony, including representatives of the Parliament of New South Wales in Australia who are generously presenting a new Mace to you, recognises the wider community of parliamentary democracy of which the National Assembly is a part.
The presence of the Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons reminds us of the long and distinguished parliamentary tradition from which this vigorous, young Assembly springs.
The Houses of Parliament in London are historic landmarks of which we as a nation are rightly proud.
We recognise the ingenuity of the architecture as well as the skills of the craftsmen who built them.
The buildings, through the famous speeches and exchanges, the great debates and historic votes, are for ever associated with some of our most profound values and ideals, and have therefore become a symbol of our nation.
It is for you, the members of the National Assembly, to ensure that this building, is in time worthy of similar respect and affection.
The skill and imagination of those who have designed and constructed this remarkable example of modern architecture have given you a dramatic setting in which to work.
It shows pride and confidence - in the future of Wales, in the future of democracy, and in the central role of the National Assembly in the life of the nation.
It is now up to you, by giving meaning to the ideals and aspirations of those you serve, by expressing the spirit of your rich and ancient culture, by shaping the very future of this country, to make this National Assembly a true symbol of Wales.
The Queen's Easter message
May the living flame of the Easter hope be a steady guide as we face the future.
Many religions have festivals which celebrate light overcoming darkness.
Such occasions are often accompanied by the lighting of candles.
They seem to speak to every culture, and appeal to people of all faiths, and of none.
They are lit on birthday cakes and to mark family anniversaries, when we gather happily around a source of light.
It unites us.
As darkness falls on the Saturday before Easter Day, many Christians would normally light candles together.
In church, one light would pass to another, spreading slowly and then more rapidly as more candles are lit.
It’s a way of showing how the good news of Christ’s resurrection has been passed on from the first Easter by every generation until now.
This year, Easter will be different for many of us, but by keeping apart we keep others safe.
But Easter isn’t cancelled; indeed, we need Easter as much as ever.
The discovery of the risen Christ on the first Easter Day gave his followers new hope and fresh purpose, and we can all take heart from this.
We know that Coronavirus will not overcome us.
As dark as death can be — particularly for those suffering with grief — light and life are greater.
May the living flame of the Easter hope be a steady guide as we face the future.
A speech by The Queen at Lambeth Palace, 2012
The Church has a duty to protect the free practice of all faiths in this countryYour Grace, Ladies and Gentlemen,Prince Philip and I are delighted to be with you today to pay tribute to the particular mission of Christianity and the general value of faith in this country.
This gathering is a reminder of how much we owe the nine major religious traditions represented here.
They are sources of a rich cultural heritage and have given rise to beautiful sacred objects and holy texts, as we have seen today.
Yet these traditions are also contemporary families of faith.
Our religions provide critical guidance for the way we live our lives, and for the way in which we treat each other.
Many of the values and ideas we take for granted in this and other countries originate in the ancient wisdom of our traditions.
Even the concept of a Jubilee is rooted in the Bible.
Here at Lambeth Palace we should remind ourselves of the significant position of the Church of England in our nation’s life.
The concept of our established Church is occasionally misunderstood and, I believe, commonly under-appreciated.
Its role is not to defend Anglicanism to the exclusion of other religions.
Instead, the Church has a duty to protect the free practice of all faiths in this country.
It certainly provides an identity and spiritual dimension for its own many adherents.
But also, gently and assuredly, the Church of England has created an environment for other faith communities and indeed people of no faith to live freely.
Woven into the fabric of this country, the Church has helped to build a better society – more and more in active co-operation for the common good with those of other faiths.
This occasion is thus an opportunity to reflect on the importance of faith in creating and sustaining communities all over the United Kingdom.
Faith plays a key role in the identity of many millions of people, providing not only a system of belief but also a sense of belonging.
It can act as a spur for social action.
Indeed, religious groups have a proud track record of helping those in the greatest need, including the sick, the elderly, the lonely and the disadvantaged.
They remind us of the responsibilities we have beyond ourselves.
A speech by The Queen at the US State Banquet, 2011
This exchange of people and projects has enlarged and invigorated our common language – although I think you will agree we do not always use it in quite the same way!Mr President,I am delighted to welcome you and Mrs Obama to London.
Prince Philip and I are so glad that you are visiting the United Kingdom again.
We have fond memories of our first meeting during the G20 Conference in London in 2009.
It also gave me much pleasure to welcome Mrs Obama and your two daughters here almost two years ago.
Your visit to this country inevitably reminds us of our shared history, our common language, and our strong intellectual and cultural links.
It also reminds us that your country twice came to the rescue of the free and democratic world when it was facing military disaster.
On each occasion, after the end of those destructive wars, the generosity of the United States made a massive contribution to our economic recovery.
Today the United States remains our most important ally and our two nations contribute to the security and prosperity of our peoples, and of the world, through shared national interests.
But our relationship goes far beyond our military and diplomatic ties.
In your inaugural address, you spoke to the American people of the values that lay at the heart of your nation’s success: ‘honesty and hard work, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism’; and of the ‘sturdy alliances and enduring convictions’ with which your nation had met past challenges and would meet future ones, too.
If I may say so, these values underscore much of the life of the United Kingdom also.
Together with our alliance, they continue to guide our actions as we confront the challenges of a changing world.
It is unfortunate that there are so many troubles facing the world today, but we are encouraged that in most respects our two countries see these problems in the same light.
For this reason we have been able to act together in fields as varied as science, research and higher education to find solutions or to at least make progress towards tackling so many of the social and economic difficulties that confront nations in all parts of the globe.
Entertainment may not be so obviously an example of our close ties, but it forms part of the lives of a great many of our people.
Over the years, we have enjoyed some of America’s most spectacular musical productions and any number of what we call films – and you might prefer to call movies.
In return, British films and theatrical productions have achieved considerable success in your country.
This exchange of people and projects has enlarged and invigorated our common language – although I think you will agree we do not always use it in quite the same way!Mr President, I firmly believe that the strength of our links and many shared interests will continue to ensure that when the United States and the United Kingdom stand together, our people and other people of goodwill around the world will be more secure and can become more prosperous.
A message from Her Majesty The Queen to the British Chambers of Commerce
As many organisations around the country are reopening, I send my warmest best wishes and support to business communities throughout the United Kingdom, Commonwealth and across the world.
As many organisations around the country are reopening, I send my warmest best wishes and support to business communities throughout the United Kingdom, Commonwealth and across the world.
At a time of great difficulty for many, it is heart-warming to see the civic response and generosity of so many businesses, small and large, to the challenges posed, whether supporting the health sector or vulnerable communities.
As Patron of the British Chambers of Commerce, it gives me great pride to see the contribution you and your members are making to help firms, champion trade and rebuild communities.
I wish all businesses every success in their endeavours in the weeks and months ahead.
The Queen’s Speech at the State Banquet in honour of the President of the Republic of Colombia
The Queen's speech at a State Banquet at Buckingham Palace on the opening day of the Colombia State Visit.
I am sure of a shared, bright future for both of our countries as long-standing allies working together towards global peace and prosperityMr.
President,Prince Philip and I are delighted to welcome you and Señora Clemencia Rodriguez de Santos to Buckingham Palace.
It has been five years since we first met, during your last official visit to London, a city where you have previously studied and worked.
Colombia's liberator, Simon Bolivar, also knew London well.
After he came here to seek this country's help, thousands of British and Irish soldiers went to Colombia to help it re-gain its independence, along with substantial finance and other support.
Some two hundred years later, we continue to be close partners in so many areas, and the United Kingdom is proud to be one of your largest foreign investors, as well as being the top international study destination for Colombian postgraduates.
Indeed, tomorrow, you will return to the London School of Economics to set out your vision for Colombia’s future and the role young people can play in it.
Of course, our trading relationship is two-way.
While British interests in Colombia include infrastructure, healthcare and energy, we also benefit from Colombian produce here in the U.K.  I am most grateful to your Ambassador for his gift of two of these world-famous products: Colombian flowers form part of this evening's floral arrangements, and the Colombian coffee we enjoyed at today's lunch will also be served later this evening and at tomorrow morning's business breakfast meeting.
Which should ensure that everyone is wide awake.
Two years ago, when The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall were in Colombia, they saw the unparalleled beauty and biodiversity of your country, and the friendship and warmth of the Colombian people – as well as experiencing Bogotá's wonderful climate.
Mr President, your visit comes at a defining moment, not just in our shared history, but also for Colombia.
The Colombian author Laura Restrepo once wrote, "War or indifference; it's hard to know which is the hardest to fight " - a phrase which continues to ring true in this uncertain world.
It is a reminder that the waging of peace is the hardest form of leadership of all, but also the most rewarding.
Finding the balance between deeply-held opposing views, while never forgetting the needs of the disengaged, requires patience, resourcefulness and grit.
Although you have faced recent setbacks, to have come to the cusp of a historic peace agreement, against the expectations of many, is a testament to your courage and perseverance, and that of the Colombian people.
I am delighted that this determination in the face of considerable challenges was given the highest possible recognition, through the award of the 2016 Nobel Prize for Peace.
This week you will visit Northern Ireland, which now has the largest financial services market in the United Kingdom outside London.
Over recent years, I have seen at close hand the transformation of a people held back for so many years by conflict and now, through peace, beginning to realise their full potential.
As you embark on the long journey towards a stable and lasting peace, the United Kingdom will be alongside you.
Where we can, we will provide commercial, technical and political support that your country might need after decades of conflict, just as we did two centuries ago.
In that way, I am sure of a shared, bright future for both of our countries as long-standing allies working together towards global peace and prosperity.
Federal lunch in Regina, Saskatchewan, 20 May 2005
I retain a deep affection for this great country and for the people who take such pride in saying "I am Canadian".
Minister, Premier, Ladies and Gentlemen,Thank you, Minister, and all of you who have welcomed our return to Regina as we celebrate this Saskatchewan Centennial year.
During this anniversary, as we pay tribute to those who have made Saskatchewan what it is today, I recall with pleasure being greeted by Premier Tommy Douglas on my first visit to Regina in 1951.
In a lifetime of most remarkable service — first to province and later to country — Premier Douglas brought social consciousness to life in the policies that directly affected the lives of Canadians.
Such service to others reflects so much of what your grandparents and great grandparents dreamed of when Saskatchewan first became a province of the Dominion of Canada in 1905.
These men and women did not simply hope for a brighter future; they devoted every day to achieving their vision, not so much for themselves but for their children, and their grandchildren — for everyone.
During the past four days, Prince Philip and I have caught glimpses of your ancestors' dreams that have been brought to life, not by accident but through determination, perseverance and hard work.
Whether in rural settings, towns or cities, we have met citizens of Saskatchewan, of many diverse backgrounds, who are united in their desire to continue to build a society that will remain the envy of the world.
We have constantly been reminded that here in Western Canada, peoples from around the world have come together to add their own richness to the vast, colourful tapestry that is only matched by the size and beauty of the country itself.
The spirit of nation building here in Saskatchewan and Canada truly falls on fertile soil.
With this spirit the promise of the future is boundless.
The Queen's Commonwealth Day message, 2009
We can rightly celebrate the fact that the founding members’ vision of the future has become a reality.
This year the Commonwealth commemorates its foundation sixty years ago.
The London Declaration of 1949 was the start of a new era in which our member countries committed themselves to work together, in partnership and as equals, towards a shared future.
We can rightly celebrate the fact that the founding members’ vision of the future has become a reality.
The Commonwealth has evolved out of all recognition from its beginning.
It has helped give birth to modern nations, and the eight original countries have become fifty-three.
We are now home to nearly two billion people, a third of the world’s population.
Across continents and oceans, we have come to represent all the rich diversity of humankind.
Yet despite its size and scale, the Commonwealth to me has been sustained during all this change by the continuity of our mutual values and goals.
Our beliefs in freedom, democracy and human rights; development and prosperity mean as much today as they did more than half a century ago.
These values come from a common responsibility exercised by our governments and peoples.
It is this which makes the Commonwealth a family of nations and peoples, at ease with being together.
As a result, I believe we are inspired to do our best to meet people’s most pressing needs, and to develop a truly global perspective.
That is why the modern Commonwealth has stood the test of time.
But as we reflect upon our long association, we should recognise the challenges that lie ahead.
Nearly one billion people of today’s Commonwealth are under 25 years of age.
These are the people that this association must continue to serve in the future.
It is they who can help shape the Commonwealth of today, and whose children will inherit the Commonwealth of tomorrow.
To help them make the best of their opportunities, our young men and women therefore need the opportunity to become active and responsible members of the communities in which they live.
I am pleased that the Commonwealth recognises this, and is determined to continue to put young people at its centre.
A speech by The Duke of Cambridge at The Queen's Birthday Garden Party in Berlin
Our visit will reflect, and I hope reinforce, the strong and wide-ranging ties between Britain and Germany.
Vielen Dank, Herr Botschafter.
Guten Abend, meine Damen und Herren.
Thank you, Ambassador, and good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
It is a pleasure for Catherine and me to be with you on this occasion as we celebrate the birthday of my grandmother, Her Majesty The Queen.
It is just under a year since I was last in Germany, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and Britain’s role in its creation.
I am delighted to be able to return so soon – this time with Catherine, George and Charlotte.
We have already had a fascinating first day here in Berlin.
We have seen powerful symbols of the historical events which helped shape modern Germany, and spoken with those who carry that that legacy forward today.
I thank President Steinmeier and Chancellor Merkel for welcoming us so warmly.
We have also experienced the city beyond the monuments and corridors of power.
This afternoon we visited the Strassenkinder project in east Berlin, which supports homeless children and young people.
It reminds us of the difficulties faced by some of the most vulnerable people in society, even in prosperous countries such as Britain and Germany, and the value of both countries looking at examples of best practice in the other.
We look forward to seeing more of this great city during our stay here.
But we also want to get to know and understand Germany outside the capital.
Tomorrow, we travel to Heidelberg, and on Friday to Hamburg.
Our visit will reflect, and I hope reinforce, the strong and wide-ranging ties between Britain and Germany.
These include political, cultural, historical, commercial, sporting, academic and scientific links.
The United Kingdom and Germany proudly share the same values as open and democratic societies, and the same determination to champion those values and to defend them - not least through our very close defence and security partnerships.
Today, we share a fundamental interest in the peace and prosperity of the continent of Europe to which we both belong.
This relationship between the United Kingdom and Germany really matters.
It is the product of many years of working closely together.
It will continue despite Britain's recent decision to leave the European Union.
I am confident we shall remain the firmest of friends.
With this confidence in mind, I am particularly pleased that the British and German governments have agreed to double their funding of UK-German Connection, the bilateral initiative for school and youth links.
UK-German Connection was established after the State Visit of the Queen to Germany in 2004, and it provides a wide range of UK-German activities, networks and funding for schools and youth groups.
The youth of today are the leaders of tomorrow, and we want to establish friendships between our young people that will last a lifetime.
I should like to finish with a message that my grandmother The Queen has sent to you all for this evening, and which she asked me to read to you:Prince Philip and I send our warmest good wishes to all of you gathered for this special Garden Party, on the occasion of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's official visit to Germany.
We have fond memories of our five State Visits to Germany, from our first in 1965 to our most recent in 2015.
Over the course of those fifty years, British-German relations have thrived, allowing us to face the challenges and embrace the opportunities of the 21st century together.
I am delighted that The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will experience the beauty of this country and the warmth of its people when they visit Berlin, Hamburg and Heidelberg.
I hope you all have a most enjoyable evening.
- Elizabeth RVielen Dank.
Tri-Service gathering of the Armed Forces at Portsmouth, 27 June 2002
Britain is grateful to you, whether here in Portsmouth, in bases across the United Kingdom, or across the world.
Thank you, Sir Michael, for your kind words.
I very much appreciate the gift of the pair of gates for the Country Park at Sandringham.
They will always remind me of my close associations with the Armed Forces ever since my first appointment as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards in 1942 and my own service with the Auxiliary Territorial Service two years later.
I owe a particular debt of gratitude to the many members of the Armed Forces, who have given me, and my family, their personal support in so many different ways during the last fifty years.
I am only too well aware of the tremendous contribution that the Armed Forces, including the volunteer reserves, have made to the standing and reputation of this country throughout the world during my reign.
The public see their success in keeping the peace in difficult situations and their effective intervention when our national interests are threatened.
But I know that these contributions are only made possible by the continuing and very thorough process of training of individuals and units.
The high standards at times of considerable stress are the product of an efficient command structure, close integration of the three services, good leadership, and intensive practice.
I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the special strains that this service places on wives, husbands and families.
Service overseas, particularly in response to unexpected crises in distant parts of the world, inevitably disrupts family life and I want to pay tribute to all service families for their support and their toleration of frequent separation.
There is one further group that deserves a special word of appreciation.
The work of all the welfare and support organisations - such people as the Chaplains, the medical services, members of the Women's Royal Voluntary Service and Forces' Help - does not often make the headlines, but it is vital to those at the sharp end.
Opening of a new headquarters, Royal Bank of Scotland, 14 September 2005
The Bank was granted its Royal Charter 278 years ago and even a prudent bank needs to build a new headquarters once in a while.
I am delighted to have been invited to attend this very special occasion for the Royal Bank of Scotland.
The Bank was granted its Royal Charter 278 years ago and even a prudent bank needs to build a new headquarters once in a while.
I can only add my congratulations to all those who have been involved in the planning, design and construction of this imaginative building.
Buildings do not make businesses, but they do dictate the quality of the working environment, and I hope that everyone who will be working here will appreciate its state-of-the-art facilities.
For many years, Scotland has had an enviable reputation for efficient financial management in a highly competitive international market.
This building is a fine tribute to the many generations of 'canny' Scottish bankers, who have made - and are still making - such a valuable contribution to the national economy.
Opening of the new colonnade of Sydney Opera House, 13 March 2006
It was universally agreed that the Opera House was something more than a performing arts centre, more than a great work of architecture.
Your Excellency, Mr. Premier, Ladies and Gentlemen,Thank you, Mr. Premier, for your warm words of welcome.
This is a very happy occasion for Prince Philip and me - rich in associations, memories and symbolism.
The first time I came here, on a glorious summer's day fifty-two years ago, there was, of course, no Opera House.
The city was smaller, the skyline more modest, and this magnificent building was no more than a dream.
Ahead were decades of spectacular national growth, an immigration programme that was to change the face of Australian society and enrich the entire nation, a burgeoning of trade and cultural activity that would cement Australia's reputation as a generous and tolerant society, as a proud member of the international community and as a respected neighbour in her region.
I believe that all this is symbolised by the Opera House itself.
When in October 1973 I opened this building, it was universally agreed that the Opera House was something more than a performing arts centre, more than a great work of architecture.
It was seen even then as, and has certainly since become, the symbol of the nation itself - a building to which visitors happily return again and again for renewed joy and inspiration.
It is therefore most gratifying, Mr. Premier, that you have invited me to return to perform what is, in effect, my second opening ceremony.
This colonnade, and the structural modifications that go with it, is the first addition to the exterior fabric of the building since its original construction, and the first and only exterior modification to have been designed by the creator of the building, Joern Utzon.
It sets the seal on an historic partnership - one not without some strains- between the architect and the Government and people of New South Wales.
It confirms that the Opera House is not something sacred, but a living structure, a vibrant and evolving place that meets the needs of its users and reflects the wishes of the people.
It is certainly fitting that, thirty-three years after its opening, the Opera House is now being officially proposed for listing on the World Heritage register.
Christmas Broadcast 1995
But I cannot think of any Christmas of my reign when the message of the angels has been more apt.
In 1995 The Queen and her mother led national celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II.
The Queen also paid her first visit to South Africa since 1947, as the guest of President Nelson Mandela.
The Queen's Christmas Broadcast in 1995 reflected on the role of ordinary men and women in bringing peace to troubled places.
During a year of wartime commemorations which has seen Commonwealth countries honouring their past, it has sometimes been tempting to let nostalgia lend a rosy glow to memories of war, and to forget the benefits of the relatively peaceful years bought for us by the heroism and sacrifice to which we have been paying tribute.
Those who suffered the horrors of warfare, in whatever guise, will not have been prey to this temptation.
For them, war was not a "Boys' Own" tale of comradeship and good cheer, but one of hard slog, danger, suffering and exhaustion.
Those songs we sang during the VE Day commemorations did much to brighten the days of war, and they certainly cheered us last May. But, as any veteran will tell you, there was a lot more to the war years than dreaming of the White Cliffs of Dover.
In talking to the veterans, I was forcibly reminded of the detachment with which those personally unaffected by violence can view its effect on others.
This seems particularly true of Northern Ireland, where the present peace of a year and more has been welcomed by all right-thinking people here and abroad.
Now, however, the 'process' is at something of a crossroads as we speculate about what happens next.
But it seems to me that much of the expert analysis of the manoeuvring and negotiating is somewhat detached from the reality as seen by those whom I meet who live and work in Northern Ireland.
They, who for 25 years have lived their lives in the dark and relentless shadow of the gun and the bomb, do not seem to have as much time for past history and prejudice as do those who commentate and pronounce on the situation, often from afar.
For those who have seen family, friends and neighbours die by violence, the bomb and the gun are the weapons of hatred which have blighted their lives for at least a quarter of a century: surely, they say, now is the time to lay them down: surely there can be discussion of a peaceful and prosperous future conducted without the threat of a return to the old evil ways.
I echo those sentiments today.
I pray that those who can exercise that threat, whoever and wherever they may be, will be persuaded that the old way was the wrong way, and that to revert to it is unthinkable.
We heard much, in May and August this year, of how the future of the free world was saved by the ordinary men and women who did their bit for the victory of 1945.It is the ordinary men and women who, so often, have done more than anyone else to bring peace to troubled lands.
It is they who suffer most, and it is up to others to see that their courage and common sense are rewarded.
It should not be too much to ask.
During my visit to South Africa last March, I was able to see, in a township, how the energy and inspiration of one person could benefit thousands of others.
And that one person would lay no claim to be anything other than ordinary - whatever you or I might think of her!I have of course used the Christmas story before in this context.
But I cannot think of any Christmas of my reign when the message of the angels has been more apt.
Think, for instance, of all the children round the world suffering from the effects of war and the unscrupulous use of power.
Some of them are growing up in countries of the Commonwealth, an organisation which is proud of its devotion to the principle of good government.
Those children will, however, be less impressed by communiqués and good intentions than by seeing democratically elected governments governing with justice and with honour.
"Blessed be the peacemakers," Christ said, "for they shall be called the children of God."
It is especially to those of you, often peacemakers without knowing it, who are fearful of a troubled and uncertain future, that I bid a Happy Christmas.
It is your good sense and good will which have achieved so much.
It must not and will not go to waste.
May there be still happier Christmases to come, for you and your children.
You deserve the best of them.
First Nations University of Regina, Saskatchew, Canada, 17 May 2005
Bearing the cipher of Queen Victoria as well as my own, this stone is presented to the First Nations University of Canada.
Dr.
Hampton and Officials of the First Nations University of Canada,This stone was taken from the grounds of Balmoral Castle in the Highlands of Scotland - a place dear to my great great grandmother, Queen Victoria.
It symbolises the foundation of the rights of First Nations peoples reflected in treaties signed with the Crown during her reign.
Christmas Broadcast 1991
I am constantly amazed by the generosity of donors and subscribers, great and small, who give so willingly and often towards the enjoyment of others.
In 1991 Boris Yeltsin won the first public elections to be held in Russia, ushering in a new era of East-West relations.
In the same year the United States and the Soviet Union signed an historic agreement reducing their stockpiles of nuclear warheads by about a third.
The Queen's Christmas Broadcast in 1991 reflected on the enormous changes taking place across Eastern Europe and Russia, and the importance of democratic traditions.
In 1952, when I first broadcast to you at Christmas, the world was a very different place to the one we live in today.
Only seven years had passed since the end of the most destructive wars in the history of mankind.
Even the end of the hostilities did not bring the true peace for which so many had fought and died.
What became known as the 'Cold War' sustained an atmosphere of suspicion, anxiety and fear for many years.
Then, quite suddenly, everything began to change, and the changes have happened with bewildering speed.
In 1989 the Berlin Wall came down.
Since then the rest of the world has watched, fascinated, as oppressive regimes have crumbled under popular pressure.
One by one, these liberated peoples have taken the first hesitant, and sometimes painful, steps towards open and democratic societies.
Naturally, we welcome this, and it may be that we can help them achieve their aims.
But, in doing that, we need to remind ourselves of the essential elements which form the bedrock of our own free way of life - so highly valued and so easily taken for granted.
This can be an opportunity to reflect on our good fortune, and on whether we have anything to offer by way of example to those who have recently broken free of dictatorship.
We, who claim to be of the free world, should examine what we really mean by freedom, and how we can help to ensure that, once in place, it is there to stay.
There are all sorts of elements to a free society, but I believe that among the most important is the willingness of ordinary men and women to play a part in the life of their community, rather than confining themselves to their own narrow interests.
The parts they play may not be major ones - indeed they can frequently turn out to be thankless tasks.
The wonder is, though, that there are so many who are prepared to devote much of their lives, for no reward, to the service of their fellow men and women.
Without their dedication, where would our churches and charities be, for instance?
Without such people, many would be unable to enjoy the pleasure which the arts bring to our daily lives.
Governments can encourage and support, but it is the volunteers who work away for nothing in administration or spend their weekends seeing fair play, who make sport and physical recreation so worthwhile.
I am constantly amazed by the generosity of donors and subscribers, great and small, who give so willingly and often towards the enjoyment of others.
Without them these voluntary organisations simply would not exist.
The peoples of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have broken the mould of autocracy.
I hope that we will be able to help them as they learn that the democracy which has replaced it depends, not on political structures, but on the goodwill and the sense of responsibility of each and every citizen.
It is not, of course, as simple as that.
All the selfless voluntary work in the world can be wasted if it disregards the views and aspirations of others.
There are any number of reasons to find fault with each other, with our Governments, and with other countries.
But let us not take ourselves too seriously.
None of us has a monopoly of wisdom and we must always be ready to listen and respect other points of view.
At the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Zimbabwe this autumn, we saw an example of mutual tolerance and respect for the views of others on an international scale.
Leaders of the fifty nations came together to discuss the future.
They met in peace, they talked freely, they listened, they found much on which to agree, and they set a new direction for the Commonwealth.
I am sure that each derived strength and reassurance in the process.
That was just one event in a year of massive and historic change.
This time last year we were thinking of the servicemen and women in the Gulf, and of the hostages in captivity.
Our prayers for their safe homecoming have largely been answered.
This Christmas we can take heart in seeing how, in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, where it has endured years of persecution and hardship, the Christian faith is once again thriving and able to spread its message of unselfishness, compassion and tolerance.
Next February will see the fortieth anniversary of my father's death and of my Accession.
Over the years I have tried to follow my father's example and to serve you as best I can.
You have given me, in return, your loyalty and your understanding, and for that I give you my heartfelt thanks.
I feel the same obligation to you that I felt in 1952.
With your prayers, and your help, and with the love and support of my family, I shall try to serve you in the years to come.
Royal Warrant Holders' Association Golden Jubilee lunch, London, 20 March 2002
The Royal Warrant of Appointment is an ancient and honourable institution.
It symbolises excellence.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,Thank you, Lord Marchwood, for your kind words and, to all of you, thank you for the wonderful welcome you have given Prince Philip and me today.
It is a pleasure to be with you at the Association's lunch in my Golden Jubilee year.
I was particularly pleased that your President invited me to present your awards on this occasion.
Dr. Leigh is a worthy recipient of the Plowden Medal, and he joins an elite band of conservators, nominated by their peers, who stand out as a result of the contribution they are making to the advancement of their profession.
The six scholarship winners illustrate perfectly how the Queen Elizabeth Scholarship Trust is helping dedicated and talented craftsmen and women to raise their levels of skill, to the benefit not only of their own careers but also the craft base in this country as a whole.
As I am sure you know, since Queen Elizabeth enthusiastically lent her name to your charity twelve years ago, she has taken a personal interest in the work of the Trust and I look forward to reporting on this years' winners when I next see her.
As your President observed, the Royal Warrant of Appointment is an ancient and honourable institution.
It symbolises excellence.
For my part, I value greatly the standard of service you provide in so many different ways, not only to Prince Philip and myself, but also to Queen Elizabeth and The Prince of Wales and to our respective Households.
But your contribution does not end there.
In the community at large you are essentially setting standards in terms of quality and performance which others are obliged to note if not to emulate.
Your Association has always enjoyed a reputation for loyalty and generosity, but I am particularly impressed by the extent of your support for the Golden Jubilee.
I am told that the history of the Association 'A Peerage for Trade' is doing well in the bookshops.
Your rose 'Gracious Queen' is a charming idea, the more so as the sale of it will benefit the Queen Elizabeth Scholarship Trust.
I am delighted it is being planted not only at Buckingham Palace but also at Balmoral and Holyroodhouse.
Later in the year your Ball in November will I hope provide a lively and fitting end to the Association's Jubilee celebrations.
But above all, I want to thank you for your most generous gift of the sculpture scheme being created by Alexander Stoddart for the new Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace.
You could not have made a more appropriate contribution than to support this significant Jubilee project to make the Royal Collection more accessible to the public.
The new Gallery at Buckingham Palace is going to be a major extension to the previous gallery and the sculpture scheme in the entrance hall will set the tone for the treasures on display within, as will the glazed screen which you are so generously donating to the new Gallery at Holyroodhouse.
I am grateful to you all.
The link between the Crown and trade and industry is an ancient one.
In as much as it serves to foster the very highest standards, it is as relevant today as it ever was.
You represent an extraordinary cross-section of British business who can be justly proud of your achievement in making a significant contribution to the economic health of this nation.
60th anniversary D-Day commemoration in Arromanches, 6 June 2004
I take it upon myself to express the immense debt of gratitude we owe to you all.
I salute you, and thank you on behalf of our whole nation.
Ladies and Gentlemen,I am very pleased to be here with you to celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the D-Day Landings.
It is a celebration of one of the most significant military successes of the Second World War, but it is also a commemoration of the sacrifices of so many of your comrades.
The Commonwealth War Graves Commission looks after the graves of more than twenty-two thousand Commonwealth Servicemen who died fighting in Normandy.
Many more were wounded.
Their sacrifice must never be forgotten.
This audience knows of the historic significance of what took place here sixty years ago: the sheer size and scope of the operation - it included the largest massed airborne landing yet attempted anywhere and successfully made; the boldness and imagination of the concept; the months of painstaking planning; the endless training and waiting; and then the ferocity of the day itself and the campaign that followed.
None of this meticulous preparation would have achieved anything without the courage and fortitude, and the dogged determination, of the hundreds of thousands of Servicemen who landed on the beaches on that day, and then fought their way inland in the face of determined opposition.
After so many frustrating delays, the invasion of Europe, for which everyone in the free world had been praying, had finally started, and everyone hoped that it would lead to a speedy end to the war.
My father broadcast to the nation on that day and said: "Once more a supreme test has to be faced.
This time the challenge is not to fight to survive, but to fight to win the final victory for the good cause".
We are all getting older, and while it is sad that this will be the final parade in Normandy of the Normandy Veterans Association, it must not be forgotten that the members of the Association continue to care for one another; to help each other in need; to support each other in loss and to keep alive the memory of all that you achieved in those crucial days.
The Association can take great pride in all it has done and continues to do.
There is just one thing more I want to say.
What for you is a haunting memory of danger and sacrifice one summer long ago, is for your country, and for generations of your countrymen to come, one of the proudest moments in our long national history.
A speech by The Queen at the Irish State Banquet, 2011
No-one who looked to the future over the past centuries could have imagined the strength of the bonds that are now in place between the governments and the people of our two nations.
A Uachtaráin agus a chairde (President and friends).Prince Philip and I are delighted to be here, and to experience at first hand Ireland’s world-famous hospitality.
Together we have much to celebrate: the ties between our people, the shared values, and the economic, business and cultural links that make us so much more than just neighbours, that make us firm friends and equal partners.
Madam President, speaking here in Dublin Castle it is impossible to ignore the weight of history, as it was yesterday when you and I laid wreaths at the Garden of Remembrance.
Indeed, so much of this visit reminds us of the complexity of our history, its many layers and traditions, but also the importance of forbearance and conciliation.
Of being able to bow to the past, but not be bound by it.
Of course, the relationship has not always been straightforward; nor has the record over the centuries been entirely benign.
It is a sad and regrettable reality that through history our islands have experienced more than their fair share of heartache, turbulence and loss.
These events have touched us all, many of us personally, and are a painful legacy.
We can never forget those who have died or been injured, and their families.
To all those who have suffered as a consequence of our troubled past I extend my sincere thoughts and deep sympathy.
With the benefit of historical hindsight we can all see things which we would wish had been done differently or not at all.
But it is also true that no-one who looked to the future over the past centuries could have imagined the strength of the bonds that are now in place between the governments and the people of our two nations, the spirit of partnership that we now enjoy, and the lasting rapport between us.
No-one here this evening could doubt that heartfelt desire of our two nations.
Madam President, you have done a great deal to promote this understanding and reconciliation.
You set out to build bridges.
And I have seen at first hand your success in bringing together different communities and traditions on this island.
You have also shed new light on the sacrifice of those who served in the First World War.
Even as we jointly opened the Messines Peace Park in 1998, it was difficult to look ahead to the time when you and I would be standing together at Islandbridge as we were today.
That transformation is also evident in the establishment of a successful power-sharing Executive in Northern Ireland.
A knot of history that was painstakingly loosened by the British and Irish Governments together with the strength, vision and determination of the political parties in Northern Ireland.
What were once only hopes for the future have now come to pass; it is almost exactly 13 years since the overwhelming majority of people in Ireland and Northern Ireland voted in favour of the agreement signed on Good Friday 1998, paving the way for Northern Ireland to become the exciting and inspirational place that it is today.
I applaud the work of all those involved in the peace process, and of all those who support and nurture peace, including members of the police, the Gardaí, and the other emergency services, and those who work in the communities, the churches and charitable bodies like Co-operation Ireland.
Taken together, their work not only serves as a basis for reconciliation between our people and communities, but it gives hope to other peacemakers across the world that through sustained effort, peace can and will prevail.
For the world moves on quickly.
The challenges of the past have been replaced by new economic challenges which will demand the same imagination and courage.
The lessons from the peace process are clear; whatever life throws at us, our individual responses will be all the stronger for working together and sharing the load.
There are other stories written daily across these islands which do not find their voice in solemn pages of history books, or newspaper headlines, but which are at the heart of our shared narrative.
Many British families have members who live in this country, as many Irish families have close relatives in the United Kingdom.
These families share the two islands; they have visited each other and have come home to each other over the years.
They are the ordinary people who yearned for the peace and understanding we now have between our two nations and between the communities within those two nations; a living testament to how much in common we have.
These ties of family, friendship and affection are our most precious resource.
They are the lifeblood of the partnership across these islands, a golden thread that runs through all our joint successes so far, and all we will go on to achieve.
They are a reminder that we have much to do together to build a future for all our grandchildren: the kind of future our grandparents could only dream of.
Marking 60th anniversary of the end of World War II in Guernsey, 9 May 2005
Prince Philip and I are happy to be in Guernsey on this sixtieth anniversary of liberation and to have joined in the Service of ThanksgivingMr.
Bailiff,Thank you for your welcome on behalf of the People of Guernsey and your expressions of loyalty and affection.
Prince Philip and I are happy to be in Guernsey on this sixtieth anniversary of liberation and to have joined in the Service of Thanksgiving.
We were pleased to have the opportunity of meeting some of those who were liberated, evacuated or deported, and those who served in the Armed Forces of the Crown and were involved in the Island's liberation.
A speech by The Countess of Wessex at The Queen’s Birthday Party in Lebanon
It has been a privilege to experience the famous Lebanese hospitality and culture for the first time, and I am very pleased to join you tonight to celebrate the strong and growing partnership between our two nations.
"I am honoured and delighted to be in Lebanon representing the British Royal Family and I am grateful to the Embassy for their help in putting this visit together.
It has been a privilege to experience the famous Lebanese hospitality and culture for the first time, and I am very pleased to join you tonight to celebrate the strong and growing partnership between our two nations.
Standing shoulder to shoulder, our collective security, our prospects for prosperity and our determination for a more peaceful world has never been more significant.
As part of my visit, I have met with Lebanese and Syrian women who have been subjected to sexual and gender based violence, to hear the stories of their struggles against the stigma they suffer, their survival and their hopes for the future.
I am committed to supporting the UK’s efforts to work with the survivors of Gender based violence and to change attitudes towards those who fall victim through no fault of their own.
I have also been fortunate to meet a number of women from civil society engaged in peace-building and mediation around the world.
Their voices are not being sufficiently heard and their full participation in peace processes is not happening.
This evening I would like to pay tribute to the women I have met who remain determined to break through these barriers so they may take their rightful place in securing peace, wherever that may be.
But before I finish, a very special member of the British Royal Family has a few words for you, it is therefore my honour and pleasure to read a personal message to the people of Lebanon from Her Majesty The Queen.
“I am delighted that my daughter-in-law is with you this evening.
The United Kingdom recognises Lebanon as a symbol of diversity, tolerance and resilience, and I hope that the strong bond of friendship between our two countries will continue for many years.
Prince Philip and I send our warmest good wishes to the people of Lebanon, and to all those attending this evening’s receptionELIZABETH R.”
Christmas Broadcast 2010
Right around the world, people gather to compete under standard rules and, in most cases, in a spirit of friendly rivalry.
Over four hundred years ago, King James the Sixth of Scotland inherited the throne of England at a time when the Christian Church was deeply divided.
Here at Hampton Court in 1604, he convened a conference of churchmen of all shades of opinion to discuss the future of Christianity in this country.
The King agreed to commission a new translation of the Bible that was acceptable to all parties.
This was to become the King James or Authorized Bible, which next year will be exactly four centuries old.
Acknowledged as a masterpiece of English prose and the most vivid translation of the scriptures, the glorious language of this Bible has survived the turbulence of history and given many of us the most widely-recognised and beautiful descriptions of the birth of Jesus Christ which we celebrate today.
The King James Bible was a major cooperative endeavour that required the efforts of dozens of the day’s leading scholars.
The whole enterprise was guided by an interest in reaching agreement for the wider benefit of the Christian Church, and to bring harmony to the Kingdoms of England and Scotland.
Four hundred years later, it is as important as ever to build communities and create harmony, and one of the most powerful ways of doing this is through sport and games.
During this past year of abundant sporting events, I have seen for myself just how important sport is in bringing people together from all backgrounds, from all walks of life and from all age-groups.
In the parks of towns and cities, and on village greens up and down the country, countless thousands of people every week give up their time to participate in sport and exercise of all sorts, or simply encourage others to do so.
These kinds of activity are common throughout the world and play a part in providing a different perspective on life.
Apart from developing physical fitness, sport and games can also teach vital social skills.
None can be enjoyed without abiding by the rules, and no team can hope to succeed without cooperation between the players.
This sort of positive team spirit can benefit communities, companies and enterprises of all kinds.
As the success of recent Paralympics bears witness, a love of sport also has the power to help rehabilitate.
One only has to think of the injured men and women of the Armed Forces to see how an interest in games and sport can speed recovery and renew a sense of purpose, enjoyment and comradeship.
Right around the world, people gather to compete under standard rules and, in most cases, in a spirit of friendly rivalry.
Competitors know that, to succeed, they must respect their opponents; very often, they like each other too.
Sportsmen and women often speak of the enormous pride they have in representing their country, a sense of belonging to a wider family.
We see this vividly at the Commonwealth Games, for example, which is known to many as the Friendly Games and where I am sure you have noticed that it is always the competitors from the smallest countries who receive the loudest cheers.
People are capable of belonging to many communities, including a religious faith.
King James may not have anticipated quite how important sport and games were to become in promoting harmony and common interests.
But from the scriptures in the Bible which bears his name, we know that nothing is more satisfying than the feeling of belonging to a group who are dedicated to helping each other:‘Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should to do to you, do ye even so to them’.
The Queen's remarks during her visit to MI5 
Because of the nature of your work, it is without public recognition, so it is on behalf of the country that I say to you all, thank you.
I would like to take my visit here today as an opportunity to thank you all for the tireless work you do to keep our country safe.
I am always struck by the remarkable resolve with which you carry out your vital role.
There will no doubt continue to be significant threats and challenges ahead.
But on each of my visits to MI5, I have been impressed by the way that you have adapted to the changing threats to our nation.
Whether responding to the threats from the Nazis or the Cold War, domestic terrorism or the cyber sphere, you have always demonstrated the utmost commitment to your motto: “Regnum Defende”.

The Queen's message to the people of Nova Scotia
​My thoughts and prayers are with the people of Nova Scotia and all Canadians at this tragic time.
Prince Philip and I have been deeply saddened by the appalling events in Nova Scotia, and we send our condolences to the families, friends and colleagues of those who have lost their lives.
I also pay tribute to the bravery and sacrifice of the officers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and other police services who selflessly responded to these devastating attacks, and to the emergency services who are supporting those who have been injured and affected.
My thoughts and prayers are with the people of Nova Scotia and all Canadians at this tragic time.
ELIZABETH R.C'est avec une profonde tristesse que le prince Philip et moi avons appris l'horrible tragédie survenue en Nouvelle-Écosse.
Nous offrons nos condoléances aux familles, aux amis et aux collègues de ceux qui ont perdu la vie.
Je tiens également à rendre hommage au courage et aux sacrifices des agents de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada et des autres corps policiers qui sont intervenus avec abnégation durant ces attaques dévastatrices,  ainsi qu'aux services d'urgence qui aident les  gens ayant été blessés ou touchés par la situation.
Mes pensées  et mes prières accompagnent la population de la Nouvelle-Écosse et tous les Canadiens en cette période tragique.
